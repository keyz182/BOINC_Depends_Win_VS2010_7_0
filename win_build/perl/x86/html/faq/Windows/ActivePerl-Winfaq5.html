<p>Issues specific to ActivePerl.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Certain_functions_don_t_seem_to_">Certain functions don't seem to
work on ActivePerl.</a></h2>
<p>There are several functions that are unimplemented in the ActivePerl system.
Here is a complete list of unimplemented functions:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><h3>Functions for processes and process groups</h3></dt>
  <dd>
    <p><code>alarm(), getpgrp(), getppid(), getpriority(), setpgrp(), setpriority()</code></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><h3><a name="item_Fetching">Fetching user and group info</a></h3></dt>
  <dd>
    <p><code>endgrent(), endpwent(), getgrent(), getgrgid(), getgrnam(), getpwent(),

  </dd>
  <dt><h3><a name="item_System">System V interprocess communication
    functions</a></h3></dt>

<p>See the perlport and Win32 documentation pages for more information on the
portability of builtin functions in ActivePerl.</p>
 
<h2><a name="The_exec_function_doesn_t_seem_t">The exec function doesn't seem to
work under Perl for ISAPI or PerlScript. Why not?</a></h2>
<p>Perl for ISAPI and PerlScript share a process space with the web server and
any number of other extensions. As a result, the <code>exec()</code> function is
unimplemented, because it would cause the web server to terminate (the <code>exec()</code>
function executes a system command and never returns).</p>
 
<h2><a name="What_s_the_difference_between_Pe">What's the history of ActivePerl
on Windows?</a></h2>
<p>At one time, Perl on the Win32 platform was found in two versions, Gurusamy
Sarathy's port, and the ActiveState port. The ActiveState port of Perl included
such tools as Perl for ISAPI and PerlScript, at the expense of exposing Perl's
internals in a slightly different fashion than standard Perl. Sarathy's port
featured a high degree of compatibility with standard Perl, which enabled users
of Sarathy's port to use many modules that were not compatible with ActiveState
Perl.</p>
<p>The oneperl effort brought both ports of Perl together, and ActivePerl is the
standard perl distribution for the Win32 system. All modules that can be used on
Win32 can be used with this port. You no longer have to worry about whose perl
the module is for. Just grab it, compile it (if needed), and use it.</p>
 
<h2><a name="What_s_the_difference_between_ru">What's the difference between
running ActivePerl on Windows NT versus running it on Windows 95?</a></h2>
<p>There should be little difference between running Perl on the two operating
systems. You should watch for the following, though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Win32::NetAdmin, Win32::NetResource, and Win32::EventLog modules will
    not run on Windows 95.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some functions that work on Windows NT/2000 reportedly do not work or are
    buggy on Windows 95. An example is <code>flock().</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, many helpful programs that are available on Windows NT/2000 are not
    there on Windows 95. <code>hostname</code>, for example, is not available on
    Windows 95.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you're worried about using a feature from one or the other, check the
result of the function Win32::IsWinNT() to see what OS you're running on. See <a class="doc" href="ActivePerl-Winfaq9.html#What_modules_come_with_the_Perl_">What
modules come with the ActivePerl distribution?</a>.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Why_don_t_the_examples_from_the_">Why don't the examples from the
Camel book work?</a></h2>
<p>The Camel book (aka <i>Programming Perl</i> (3rd edition), Wall et.al., O'Reilly &amp;
Associates 2000) was written by UNIX people for, in general, UNIX people.</p>
<p>Some of the examples in the Camel book will work. Some will not. If they
fail, it's because either the functions used are not available, the external
tools used are not available, or the modules used are not available. Usually,
for small scripts, it's not too hard to fiddle with them until they come out
correct (see <a class="doc" href="#How_do_I_make_a_UNIX_based_scrip">How do I make a
UNIX-based script work?</a>).</p>
<p>The Camel and Llama books are good learning tools. However, one of the things
you learn as a ActivePerl programmer is how to port UNIX-targeted scripts and
modules to ActivePerl.</p>
<p>For better examples of using ActivePerl, you may want to look at the Gecko
book, ``Learning Perl on Win32 Systems,'' published by O'Reilly.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Why_don_t_certain_standard_libra">Why don't certain standard
library modules work?</a></h2>
<p>With ActivePerl, almost all modules will work with ActivePerl as long as they
can be built to run on Win32. The problems that existed with the 3xx versions of
Perl for Win32 no longer exist: modules work on Win32, not just this port or
that port of Perl for the Win32 platform!</p>
<p>If a module doesn't work, it may be because the functions it uses are
specific to UNIX and won't work on Win32, or specific to NT/2000 and won't work on
Windows 95 or Windows 98.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_make_a_UNIX_based_scrip">How do I make a UNIX-based script
work?</a></h2>
<p>First, make extra-super sure that you are using the script or module in the
way it was intended. Many of us are quick to blame the module, the operating
system, or the interpreter when, in reality, it is our own code that isn't
working right.</p>
<p>If you're sure that it's not a problem in your code, the best way to make a
UNIX-based script work is to desk-check it before running it. Look for some of
the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Calls to functions unimplemented in ActivePerl. For a list, see <a class="doc" href="#Certain_functions_don_t_seem_to_">Certain
    functions don't seem to work on ActivePerl.</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calls to standard library modules or CPAN modules that aren't available
    on ActivePerl, or that don't work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>system()</code> or backtick (``) calls to system tools that aren't
    available on ActivePerl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading and writing files that may be binary. See <a class="doc" href="ActivePerl-Winfaq8.html#Reading_from_and_writing_to_file">Reading
    from and writing to files mysteriously fails. What's wrong?</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>File-system dependent path names and path name parsing. Watch for
    hard-coded UNIX paths like <i>/usr/lib</i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The module or script may require a specific version of Perl or another
    module. Watch out for things like <code>require 5.003;</code> or <code>require
    Sockets 1.03;</code> Check to see if the script or module really requires
    the new version.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it should go without saying that for everything you take out
you'll have to put in a work-around.</p>
<p>Once you've worked around UNIX dependencies in the script or module, try
running it through the debugger to see if what you did helps. If the script or
module comes with a <i>.t</i> test file, try using that to test your changed
version.</p>
<p>If you do make a change to a UNIX-based script or module, please let the
author know. Sometimes the author will be gracious enough to make changes that
will let the program run on ActivePerl. If the author won't change the program,
ask if you can make the altered version available to other users.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_does_the_chmod_function_work">How does the chmod function work
on Win32 platforms?</a></h2>
<p><code>chmod()</code> is supported in ActivePerl. However, it can only be used
for setting &quot;owner&quot; read/write access. (The &quot;group&quot; and
&quot;other&quot; bits are ignored.)</p>
<p>UNIX-style security for files is not applicable to files on Win32 systems.
Win32 systems inherit from DOS four possible file attributes: archived (A),
read-only (R), hidden (H), and system (S). These can be checked and set with the
Win32::File::Get/SetAttributes().</p>
<p>Windows NT/2000 systems using NTFS can also have more specific permissions granted
on individual files to users and groups. For builds 300 and above, and the Perl
Resource Kit for Win32, you can use the Win32::FileSecurity module to maintain
file permissions.</p>
 
<h2><a name="4DOS_doesn_t_recognize_on_the">4DOS doesn't recognize \&quot; on
the command line.</a></h2>
<p>4DOS doesn't recognize the escaped quote on the command line, because all
double-quote characters are seen as delimiters for command line parameters. This
is one of the few points (if not the only one) where 4DOS doesn't quite match up
to <i>COMMAND.COM</i>.</p>
<p>To get around this, you can enter</p>
<pre>    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello, World\n\&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>as</p>
<pre>    perl -e &quot;print qq(Hello, World\n)&quot;
</pre>
<p>using Perl's alternative quoting mechanism. The alternative quotes are <code>qq()</code>
for double quotes, <code>q()</code> for single quotes, <code>qx()</code> for
backquotes, and <code>qw()</code> for list quotes. The parentheses can be
substituted for just about anything (like + or | or {} or &lt;&gt; or #), but
that looks weird.</p>
 
<h2><a name="STDIN_and_STDOUT_and_Piping_don">STDIN and STDOUT, and Piping don't
always work on NT/2000.</a></h2>
<p>You may get unexpected results when you try to redirect the output of files
that use Windows NT/2000's file association feature. You can use 
<a class="doc" href="http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Perl_Dev_Kit/">PerlApp</a> or pl2bat to
convert a Perl script to an executable or a batch file. This should solve any
problems you may have with redirection.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Signal_Handling">Why doesn't signal handling work on Windows?</a></h2>
<p>Signals are unsupported by the Win32 API. The C Runtime provides crude
support for signals, but there are serious caveats, such as inability to die()
or exit() from a signal handler. Perl itself does not guarantee that signal
handlers will not interrupt critical operations such as memory allocation, which
means signal invocation may throw perl internals into disarray. For these
reasons, signals are unsupported at this time.</p>
