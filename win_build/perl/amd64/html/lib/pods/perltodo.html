<p>perltodo - Perl TO-DO List</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This is a list of wishes for Perl. The tasks we think are smaller or easier
are listed first. Anyone is welcome to work on any of these, but it's a good
idea to first contact <em><a href="mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org">perl5-porters@perl.org</a></em> to avoid duplication of
effort. By all means contact a pumpking privately first if you prefer.</p>
<p>Whilst patches to make the list shorter are most welcome, ideas to add to
the list are also encouraged. Check the perl5-porters archives for past
ideas, and any discussion about them. One set of archives may be found at:</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/</a></pre>
<p>What can we offer you in return? Fame, fortune, and everlasting glory? Maybe
not, but if your patch is incorporated, then we'll add your name to the
<em class="file">AUTHORS</em> file, which ships in the official distribution. How many other
programming languages offer you 1 line of immortality?</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="tasks_that_only_need_perl_knowledge">Tasks that only need Perl knowledge</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="remove_duplication_of_test_setup_">Remove duplication of test setup.</a></h2>
<p>Schwern notes, that there's duplication of code - lots and lots of tests have
some variation on the big block of <code>$Is_Foo</code> checks.  We can safely put this
into a file, change it to build an <code>%Is</code> hash and require it.  Maybe just put
it into <em class="file">test.pl</em>. Throw in the handy tainting subroutines.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="merge_common_code_in_installperl_and_installman">merge common code in installperl and installman</a></h2>
<p>There are some common subroutines and a common <code>BEGIN</code> block in <em class="file">installperl</em>
and <em class="file">installman</em>. These should probably be merged. It would also be good to
check for duplication in all the utility scripts supplied in the source
tarball. It might be good to move them all to a subdirectory, but this would
require careful checking to find all places that call them, and change those
correctly.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="common_test_code_for_timed_bail_out">common test code for timed bail out</a></h2>
<p>Write portable self destruct code for tests to stop them burning CPU in
infinite loops. This needs to avoid using alarm, as some of the tests are
testing alarm/sleep or timers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="pod____html_conversion_in_the_core_still_sucks">POD -&gt; HTML conversion in the core still sucks</a></h2>
<p>Which is crazy given just how simple POD purports to be, and how simple HTML
can be. It's not actually <em>as</em> simple as it sounds, particularly with the
flexibility POD allows for <code>=item</code>, but it would be good to improve the
visual appeal of the HTML generated, and to avoid it having any validation
errors. See also <a href="#make_html_install_work">make HTML install work</a>, as the layout of installation tree
is needed to improve the cross-linking.</p>
<p>The addition of <code>Pod::Simple</code> and its related modules may make this task
easier to complete.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="merge_checkpods_and_podchecker">merge checkpods and podchecker</a></h2>
<p><em class="file">pod/checkpods.PL</em> (and <code>make check</code> in the <em class="file">pod/</em> subdirectory)
implements a very basic check for pod files, but the errors it discovers
aren't found by podchecker. Add this check to podchecker, get rid of
checkpods and have <code>make check</code> use podchecker.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="perlmodlib_pl_rewrite">perlmodlib.PL rewrite</a></h2>
<p>Currently perlmodlib.PL needs to be run from a source directory where perl
has been built, or some modules won't be found, and others will be
skipped. Make it run from a clean perl source tree (so it's reproducible).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="parallel_testing">Parallel testing</a></h2>
<p>(This probably impacts much more than the core: also the Test::Harness
and TAP::* modules on CPAN.)</p>
<p>The core regression test suite is getting ever more comprehensive, which has
the side effect that it takes longer to run. This isn't so good. Investigate
whether it would be feasible to give the harness script the <strong>option</strong> of
running sets of tests in parallel. This would be useful for tests in
<em class="file">t/op/*.t</em> and <em class="file">t/uni/*.t</em> and maybe some sets of tests in <em class="file">lib/</em>.</p>
<p>Questions to answer</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does screen layout work when you're running more than one test?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the caller of test specify how many tests to run in parallel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do setup/teardown tests identify themselves?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pugs already does parallel testing - can their approach be re-used?</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_schwern_poorer">Make Schwern poorer</a></h2>
<p>We should have tests for everything. When all the core's modules are tested,
Schwern has promised to donate to $500 to TPF. We may need volunteers to
hold him upside down and shake vigorously in order to actually extract the
cash.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="improve_the_coverage_of_the_core_tests">Improve the coverage of the core tests</a></h2>
<p>Use Devel::Cover to ascertain the core modules's test coverage, then add
tests that are currently missing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="test_b">test B</a></h2>
<p>A full test suite for the B module would be nice.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="deparse_inlined_constants">Deparse inlined constants</a></h2>
<p>Code such as this</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">constant</span> <span class="string">PI</span> <span class="operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="number">4</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="keyword">warn</span> <span class="variable">PI</span>
</pre>
<p>will currently deparse as</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">constant</span> <span class="operator">(</span><span class="string">'PI'</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="number">4</span><span class="operator">);</span>
    <span class="keyword">warn</span> <span class="number">4</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</pre>
<p>because the tokenizer inlines the value of the constant subroutine <code>PI</code>.
This allows various compile time optimisations, such as constant folding
and dead code elimination. Where these haven't happened (such as the example
above) it ought be possible to make B::Deparse work out the name of the
original constant, because just enough information survives in the symbol
table to do this. Specifically, the same scalar is used for the constant in
the optree as is used for the constant subroutine, so by iterating over all
symbol tables and generating a mapping of SV address to constant name, it
would be possible to provide B::Deparse with this functionality.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="a_decent_benchmark">A decent benchmark</a></h2>
<p><code>perlbench</code> seems impervious to any recent changes made to the perl core. It
would be useful to have a reasonable general benchmarking suite that roughly
represented what current perl programs do, and measurably reported whether
tweaks to the core improve, degrade or don't really affect performance, to
guide people attempting to optimise the guts of perl. Gisle would welcome
new tests for perlbench.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="fix_tainting_bugs">fix tainting bugs</a></h2>
<p>Fix the bugs revealed by running the test suite with the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#t"><code>-t</code></a> switch (via
<code>make test.taintwarn</code>).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="dual_life_everything">Dual life everything</a></h2>
<p>As part of the &quot;dists&quot; plan, anything that doesn't belong in the smallest perl
distribution needs to be dual lifed. Anything else can be too. Figure out what
changes would be needed to package that module and its tests up for CPAN, and
do so. Test it with older perl releases, and fix the problems you find.</p>
<p>To make a minimal perl distribution, it's useful to look at
<em class="file">t/lib/commonsense.t</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="improving_threads__shared">Improving <code>threads::shared</code></a></h2>
<p>Investigate whether <code>threads::shared</code> could share aggregates properly with
only Perl level changes to shared.pm</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="posix_memory_footprint">POSIX memory footprint</a></h2>
<p>Ilya observed that use POSIX; eats memory like there's no tomorrow, and at
various times worked to cut it down. There is probably still fat to cut out -
for example POSIX passes Exporter some very memory hungry data structures.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="embed_pl_makedef_pl">embed.pl/makedef.pl</a></h2>
<p>There is a script <em class="file">embed.pl</em> that generates several header files to prefix
all of Perl's symbols in a consistent way, to provide some semblance of
namespace support in <code>C</code>. Functions are declared in <em class="file">embed.fnc</em>, variables
in <em class="file">interpvar.h</em>. Quite a few of the functions and variables
are conditionally declared there, using <code>#ifdef</code>. However, <em class="file">embed.pl</em>
doesn't understand the C macros, so the rules about which symbols are present
when is duplicated in <em class="file">makedef.pl</em>. Writing things twice is bad, m'kay.
It would be good to teach <code>embed.pl</code> to understand the conditional
compilation, and hence remove the duplication, and the mistakes it has caused.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="use_strict__and_autoload">use strict; and AutoLoad</a></h2>
<p>Currently if you write</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">package</span> <span class="variable">Whack</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">AutoLoader</span> <span class="string">'AUTOLOAD'</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">strict</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="number">1</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="comment">__END__
    sub bloop {
        print join (' ', No, strict, here), "!\n";
    }
    </span>
</pre>
<p>then <code>use strict;</code> isn't in force within the autoloaded subroutines. It would
be more consistent (and less surprising) to arrange for all lexical pragmas
in force at the __END__ block to be in force within each autoloaded subroutine.</p>
<p>There's a similar problem with SelfLoader.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="tasks_that_need_a_little_sysadmin_type_knowledge">Tasks that need a little sysadmin-type knowledge</a></h1>
<p>Or if you prefer, tasks that you would learn from, and broaden your skills
base...</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_html_install_work">make HTML install work</a></h2>
<p>There is an <code>installhtml</code> target in the Makefile. It's marked as
&quot;experimental&quot;. It would be good to get this tested, make it work reliably, and
remove the &quot;experimental&quot; tag. This would include</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Checking that cross linking between various parts of the documentation works.
In particular that links work between the modules (files with POD in <em class="file">lib/</em>)
and the core documentation (files in <em class="file">pod/</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out how to split <code>perlfunc</code> into chunks, preferably one per function
group, preferably with general case code that could be used elsewhere.
Challenges here are correctly identifying the groups of functions that go
together, and making the right named external cross-links point to the right
page. Things to be aware of are <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#x"><code>-X</code></a>, groups such as <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#getpwnam"><code>getpwnam</code></a> to
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#endservent"><code>endservent</code></a>, two or more <code>=items</code> giving the different parameter lists, such
as</p>
<pre>
    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH,REPLACEMENT
    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH
    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET</pre>
<p>and different parameter lists having different meanings. (eg <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#select"><code>select</code></a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="compressed_man_pages">compressed man pages</a></h2>
<p>Be able to install them. This would probably need a configure test to see how
the system does compressed man pages (same directory/different directory?
same filename/different filename), as well as tweaking the <em class="file">installman</em> script
to compress as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="add_a_code_coverage_target_to_the_makefile">Add a code coverage target to the Makefile</a></h2>
<p>Make it easy for anyone to run Devel::Cover on the core's tests. The steps
to do this manually are roughly</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>do a normal <code>Configure</code>, but include Devel::Cover as a module to install
(see <em class="file">INSTALL</em> for how to do this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
    make perl</pre>
<li>
<pre>
    <span class="variable">cd</span> <span class="variable">t</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="variable">HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES</span><span class="operator">=-</span><span class="variable">MDevel::Cover</span> <span class="operator">.</span><span class="regex">/perl -I../lib</span> <span class="variable">harness</span>
</pre>
<li>
<p>Process the resulting Devel::Cover database</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This just give you the coverage of the <em class="file">.pm</em>s. To also get the C level
coverage you need to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Additionally tell <code>Configure</code> to use the appropriate C compiler flags for
<code>gcov</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
    make perl.gcov</pre>
<p>(instead of <code>make perl</code>)</p>
<li>
<p>After running the tests run <code>gcov</code> to generate all the <em class="file">.gcov</em> files.
(Including down in the subdirectories of <em class="file">ext/</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(From the top level perl directory) run <code>gcov2perl</code> on all the <code>.gcov</code> files
to get their stats into the cover_db directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then process the Devel::Cover database</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be good to add a single switch to <code>Configure</code> to specify that you
wanted to perform perl level coverage, and another to specify C level
coverage, and have <code>Configure</code> and the <em class="file">Makefile</em> do all the right things
automatically.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_config_pm_cope_with_differences_between_built_and_installed_perl">Make Config.pm cope with differences between built and installed perl</a></h2>
<p>Quite often vendors ship a perl binary compiled with their (pay-for)
compilers.  People install a free compiler, such as gcc. To work out how to
build extensions, Perl interrogates <code>%Config</code>, so in this situation
<code>%Config</code> describes compilers that aren't there, and extension building
fails. This forces people into choosing between re-compiling perl themselves
using the compiler they have, or only using modules that the vendor ships.</p>
<p>It would be good to find a way teach <code>Config.pm</code> about the installation setup,
possibly involving probing at install time or later, so that the <code>%Config</code> in
a binary distribution better describes the installed machine, when the
installed machine differs from the build machine in some significant way.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="linker_specification_files">linker specification files</a></h2>
<p>Some platforms mandate that you provide a list of a shared library's external
symbols to the linker, so the core already has the infrastructure in place to
do this for generating shared perl libraries. My understanding is that the
GNU toolchain can accept an optional linker specification file, and restrict
visibility just to symbols declared in that file. It would be good to extend
<em class="file">makedef.pl</em> to support this format, and to provide a means within
<code>Configure</code> to enable it. This would allow Unix users to test that the
export list is correct, and to build a perl that does not pollute the global
namespace with private symbols.</p>

<h2><a name="cross_compile_support">Cross-compile support</a></h2>
<p>Currently <code>Configure</code> understands <code>-Dusecrosscompile</code> option. This option
arranges for building <code>miniperl</code> for TARGET machine, so this <code>miniperl</code> is
assumed then to be copied to TARGET machine and used as a replacement of full
<code>perl</code> executable.</p>
<p>This could be done little differently. Namely <code>miniperl</code> should be built for
HOST and then full <code>perl</code> with extensions should be compiled for TARGET.
This, however, might require extra trickery for %Config: we have one config
first for HOST and then another for TARGET.  Tools like MakeMaker will be
mightily confused.  Having around two different types of executables and
libraries (HOST and TARGET) makes life interesting for Makefiles and
shell (and Perl) scripts.  There is $Config{run}, normally empty, which
can be used as an execution wrapper.  Also note that in some
cross-compilation/execution environments the HOST and the TARGET do
not see the same filesystem(s), the $Config{run} may need to do some
file/directory copying back and forth.</p>

<h2><a name="make_it_clear_from__v_if_this_is_the_exact_official_release">Make it clear from -v if this is the exact official release</a></h2>
<p>Currently perl from <code>p4</code>/<code>rsync</code> ships with a <em class="file">patchlevel.h</em> file that
usually defines one local patch, of the form &quot;MAINT12345&quot; or &quot;RC1&quot;. The output
of perl -v doesn't report that a perl isn't an official release, and this
information can get lost in bugs reports. Because of this, the minor version
isn't bumped up until RC time, to minimise the possibility of versions of perl
escaping that believe themselves to be newer than they actually are.</p>
<p>It would be useful to find an elegant way to have the &quot;this is an interim
maintenance release&quot; or &quot;this is a release candidate&quot; in the terse -v output,
and have it so that it's easy for the pumpking to remove this just as the
release tarball is rolled up. This way the version pulled out of rsync would
always say &quot;I'm a development release&quot; and it would be safe to bump the
reported minor version as soon as a release ships, which would aid perl
developers.</p>
<p>This task is really about thinking of an elegant way to arrange the C source
such that it's trivial for the Pumpking to flag &quot;this is an official release&quot;
when making a tarball, yet leave the default source saying &quot;I'm not the
official release&quot;.</p>

<h2><a name="profile_perl___am_i_hot_or_not">Profile Perl - am I hot or not?</a></h2>
<p>The Perl source code is stable enough that it makes sense to profile it,
identify and optimise the hotspots. It would be good to measure the
performance of the Perl interpreter using free tools such as cachegrind,
gprof, and dtrace, and work to reduce the bottlenecks they reveal.</p>
<p>As part of this, the idea of <em class="file">pp_hot.c</em> is that it contains the <em>hot</em> ops,
the ops that are most commonly used. The idea is that by grouping them, their
object code will be adjacent in the executable, so they have a greater chance
of already being in the CPU cache (or swapped in) due to being near another op
already in use.</p>
<p>Except that it's not clear if these really are the most commonly used ops. So
as part of exercising your skills with coverage and profiling tools you might
want to determine what ops <em>really</em> are the most commonly used. And in turn
suggest evictions and promotions to achieve a better <em class="file">pp_hot.c</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="allocate_ops_from_arenas">Allocate OPs from arenas</a></h2>
<p>Currently all new OP structures are individually malloc()ed and free()d.
All <code>malloc</code> implementations have space overheads, and are now as fast as
custom allocates so it would both use less memory and less CPU to allocate
the various OP structures from arenas. The SV arena code can probably be
re-used for this.</p>
<p>Note that Configuring perl with <code>-Accflags=-DPL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC</code> will use
<code>Perl_Slab_alloc()</code> to pack optrees into a contiguous block, which is
probably superior to the use of OP arenas, esp. from a cache locality
standpoint.  See <a href="#profile_perl___am_i_hot_or_not">Profile Perl - am I hot or not?</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a similar issue with POSIX CRT function names like fileno having
been deprecated in favour of ISO C++ conformant names like _fileno. These
warnings are also currently suppressed by adding -D_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE. It
might be nice to do as Microsoft suggest here too, although, unlike the secure

<p>Perl's diagnostics (error messages, see <a href="../../lib/pods/perldiag.html">the perldiag manpage</a>) could use
reorganizing and formalizing so that each error message has its
stable-for-all-eternity unique id, categorized by severity, type, and
subsystem.  (The error messages would be listed in a datafile outside
of the Perl source code, and the source code would only refer to the
messages by the id.)  This clean-up and regularizing should apply
for all <code>croak()</code> messages.</p>
<p>This would enable all sorts of things: easier translation/localization
of the messages (though please do keep in mind the caveats of
<a href="../../lib/Locale/Maketext.html">the Locale::Maketext manpage</a> about too straightforward approaches to
translation), filtering by severity, and instead of grepping for a
particular error message one could look for a stable error id.  (Of
course, changing the error messages by default would break all the
existing software depending on some particular error message...)</p>
<p>This kind of functionality is known as <em>message catalogs</em>.  Look for

<h2><a name="regexp_optimiser_optional">regexp optimiser optional</a></h2>
<p>The regexp optimiser is not optional. It should configurable to be, to allow
its performance to be measured, and its bugs to be easily demonstrated.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="delete__function">delete &amp;function</a></h2>
<p>Allow to delete functions. One can already undef them, but they're still
in the stash.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_w_regex_modifier"><a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>/w</code></a> regex modifier</a></h2>
<p>That flag would enable to match whole words, and also to interpolate
arrays as alternations. With it, <code>/P/w</code> would be roughly equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="operator">{</span> <span class="keyword">local</span> <span class="variable">$"</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="string">'|'</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="regex">/\b(?:P)\b/</span> <span class="operator">}</span>

for the discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="optional_optimizer">optional optimizer</a></h2>
<p>Make the peephole optimizer optional. Currently it performs two tasks as
it walks the optree - genuine peephole optimisations, and necessary fixups of
ops. It would be good to find an efficient way to switch out the
optimisations whilst keeping the fixups.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="you_want__how__many">You WANT *how* many</a></h2>
<p>Currently contexts are void, scalar and list. split has a special mechanism in
place to pass in the number of return values wanted. It would be useful to
have a general mechanism for this, backwards compatible and little speed hit.
This would allow proposals such as short circuiting sort to be implemented
as a module on CPAN.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="lexical_aliases">lexical aliases</a></h2>
<p>Allow lexical aliases (maybe via the syntax <code>my \$alias = \$foo</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="entersub_xs_vs_perl">entersub XS vs Perl</a></h2>
<p>At the moment pp_entersub is huge, and has code to deal with entering both
perl and XS subroutines. Subroutine implementations rarely change between 
perl and XS at run time, so investigate using 2 ops to enter subs (one for
XS, one for perl) and swap between if a sub is redefined.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="self_ties">Self-ties</a></h2>
<p>Self-ties are currently illegal because they caused too many segfaults. Maybe
the causes of these could be tracked down and self-ties on all types
reinstated.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="optimize_away___">Optimize away @_</a></h2>
<p>The old perltodo notes &quot;Look at the &quot;reification&quot; code in <code>av.c</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="the_yada_yada_yada_operators">The yada yada yada operators</a></h2>
<p>Perl 6's Synopsis 3 says:</p>
<p><em>The ... operator is the &quot;yada, yada, yada&quot; list operator, which is used as
the body in function prototypes. It complains bitterly (by calling fail)
if it is ever executed. Variant ??? calls warn, and !!! calls die.</em></p>
<p>Those would be nice to add to Perl 5. That could be done without new ops.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="virtualize_operating_system_access">Virtualize operating system access</a></h2>
<p>Implement a set of &quot;vtables&quot; that virtualizes operating system access
(open(), <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#mkdir"><code>mkdir()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#unlink"><code>unlink()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#readdir"><code>readdir()</code></a>, <code>getenv()</code>, etc.)  At the very
least these interfaces should take SVs as &quot;name&quot; arguments instead of
bare char pointers; probably the most flexible and extensible way
would be for the Perl-facing interfaces to accept HVs.  The system
needs to be per-operating-system and per-file-system
hookable/filterable, preferably both from XS and Perl level
(<a href="../../lib/pods/perlport.html#files_and_filesystems">Files and Filesystems in the perlport manpage</a> is good reading at this point,
in fact, all of <a href="../../lib/pods/perlport.html">the perlport manpage</a> is.)</p>
<p>This has actually already been implemented (but only for Win32),
take a look at <em class="file">iperlsys.h</em> and <em class="file">win32/perlhost.h</em>.  While all Win32
variants go through a set of &quot;vtables&quot; for operating system access,
non-Win32 systems currently go straight for the POSIX/UNIX-style
system/library call.  Similar system as for Win32 should be
implemented for all platforms.  The existing Win32 implementation
probably does not need to survive alongside this proposed new
implementation, the approaches could be merged.</p>
<p>What would this give us?  One often-asked-for feature this would
enable is using Unicode for filenames, and other &quot;names&quot; like %ENV,
usernames, hostnames, and so forth.
(See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlunicode.html#when_unicode_does_not_happen">When Unicode Does Not Happen in the perlunicode manpage</a>.)</p>
<p>But this kind of virtualization would also allow for things like
virtual filesystems, virtual networks, and &quot;sandboxes&quot; (though as long
as dynamic loading of random object code is allowed, not very safe
sandboxes since external code of course know not of Perl's vtables).
An example of a smaller &quot;sandbox&quot; is that this feature can be used to
implement per-thread working directories: Win32 already does this.</p>

<h2><a name="investigate_padtmp_hash_pessimisation">Investigate PADTMP hash pessimisation</a></h2>
<p>The peephole optimier converts constants used for hash key lookups to shared
hash key scalars. Under ithreads, something is undoing this work. See

<p>Tasks that will get your name mentioned in the description of the &quot;Highlights
of 5.12&quot;</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_ithreads_more_robust">make ithreads more robust</a></h2>
<p>Generally make ithreads more robust. See also <a href="#icow">iCOW</a></p>
<p>This task is incremental - even a little bit of work on it will help, and
will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>One bit would be to write the missing code in sv.c:Perl_dirp_dup.</p>
<p>Fix Perl_sv_dup, et al so that threads can return objects.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="icow">iCOW</a></h2>
<p>Sarathy and Arthur have a proposal for an improved Copy On Write which
specifically will be able to COW new ithreads. If this can be implemented
it would be a good thing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="________closures_in_regexps">(?{...}) closures in regexps</a></h2>
<p>Fix (or rewrite) the implementation of the <code>/(?{...})/</code> closures.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="a_re_entrant_regexp_engine">A re-entrant regexp engine</a></h2>
<p>This will allow the use of a regex from inside (?{ }), (??{ }) and
(?(?{ })|) constructs.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="add_class_set_operations_to_regexp_engine">Add class set operations to regexp engine</a></h2>
<p>Apparently these are quite useful. Anyway, Jeffery Friedl wants them.</p>
<p>demerphq has this on his todo list, but right at the bottom.</p>
