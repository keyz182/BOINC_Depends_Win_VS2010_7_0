</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_1_16_may_13__2008">Changes in DBD::ODBC 1.16 May 13, 2008</a></h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="test_changes">Test Changes</a></h3>
<p>Small change to the last test in 10handler.t to cope with the prepare
failing instead of the execute failing - spotted by Andrei Kovalevski
with the ODBCng Postgres driver.</p>
<p>Changed the 20SqlServer.t test to specifically disable MARS for the
test to check multiple active statements and added a new test to check
that when MARS_Connection is enabled multiple active statements are
allowed.</p>
<p>Changed the 09multi.t test to use ; as a SQL statement seperator
instead of a newline.</p>
<p>A few minor &quot;use of unitialised&quot; fixes in tests when a test fails.</p>
<p>In 02simple.t Output DBMS_NAME/VER, DRIVER_NAME/VER as useful
debugging aid when cpan testers report a fail.</p>
<p>2 new tests for odbc_query_timeout added to 03dbatt.t.</p>
<p>Changed 02simple.t test which did not work for Oracle due to a &quot;select
1&quot; in the test. Test changed to do &quot;select 1 from dual&quot; for Oracle.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="documentation_changes">Documentation Changes</a></h3>
<p>Added references to DBD::ODBC ohloh listing and markmail archives.</p>
<p>Added Tracing sections.</p>
<p>Added &quot;Deviations from the DBI specification&quot; section.</p>
<p>Moved the FAQ entries from ODBC.pm to new FAQ document. You can view
the FAQ with perldoc DBD::ODBC::FAQ.</p>
<p>Added provisional README.windows document.</p>
<p>Rewrote pod for odbc_query_timeout.</p>
<p>Added a README.osx.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="internal_changes">Internal Changes</a></h3>
<p>More tracing in dbdimp.c for named parameters.</p>
<p>#ifdeffed out odbc_get_primary_keys in dbdimp.c as it is no longer
used.  $h-&gt;func($catalog, $schema, $table, 'GetPrimaryKeys') ends up
in dbdimp.c/dbd_st_primary_keys now.</p>
<p>Reformatted dbdimp.c to avoid going over 80 columns.</p>
<p>Tracing changed. Levels reviewed and changed in many cases avoiding levels 1
and 2 which are reserved for DBI. Now using DBIc_TRACE macro internally.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="build_changes">Build Changes</a></h3>
<p>Changes to Makefile.PL to fix a newly introduced bug with 'tr', remove
easysoft OOB detection and to try and use odbc_config and odbcinst if
we find them to aid automatic configuration. This latter change also
adds &quot;odbc_config --cflags&quot; to the CC line when building DBD::ODBC.</p>
<p>Avoid warning when testing ExtUtils::MakeMaker version and it is a
test release with an underscore in the version.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="functionality_changes">Functionality Changes</a></h3>
<p>Added support for parse_trace_flag and parse_trace_flags methods and
defined a DBD::ODBC private flag 'odbcdev' as a test case.</p>
<p>Add support for the 'SQL' trace type. Added private trace type odbcdev
as an experimental start.</p>
<p>Change odbc_query_timeout attribute handling so if it is set to 0
after having set it to a non-zero value the default of no time out is
restored.</p>
<p>Added support for DBI's statistics_info method.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="bug_fixes">Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<p>Fix bug in support for named placeholders leading to error &quot;Can't
rebind placeholder&quot; when there is more than one named placeholder.</p>
<p>Guard against scripts attempting to use a named placeholder more than
once in a single SQL statement.</p>
<p>If you called some methods after disconnecting (e.g., prepare/do and
any of the DBD::ODBC specific methods via &quot;func&quot;) then no error was
generated.</p>
<p>Fixed issue with use of true/false as fields names in structure on MAC
OS X 10.5 (Leopard) thanks to Hayden Stainsby.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_1_15_january_29__2008">Changes in DBD::ODBC 1.15 January 29, 2008</a></h2>
<p>1.15 final release.</p>
<p>Fixed bug reported by Toni Salomaki where DBD::ODBC may call
SQLNumResultCols after SQLMoreResults returns SQL_NO_DATA. It led to
the error:</p>
<p>Describe failed during DBI::st=HASH(0x19c2048)-&gt;FETCH(NUM_OF_FIELDS,0)</p>
<p>when NUM_OF_FIELDS was referenced in the Perl script.</p>
<p>Updated odbc_exec_direct documentation to describe its requirement
when creating temporary objects in SQL Server.</p>
<p>Added FAQ on SQL Server temporary tables.</p>
<p>Fixed bug in dbdimp.c which was using SQL_WCHAR without testing it was
defined - thanks Jergen Dutch.</p>
<p>Fixed use of &quot;our&quot; in UCHelp.pm which fails on older Perls.</p>
<p>Minor changes to 02simple.t and 03dbatt.t to fix diagnostics output
and help debug DBD which does not handle long data properly.</p>
<p>Further changes to Makefile.PL to avoid change in behavior of
ExtUtils::MakeMaker wrt order of execution of PREREQ_PM and CONFIGURE.
Now if DBI::DBD is not installed we just warn and exit 0 to avoid a
cpan-testers failure.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_1_15_2_november_14__2007">Changes in DBD::ODBC 1.15_2 November 14, 2007</a></h2>
<p>Fix bug in DBD::ODBC's private function data_sources which was
returning data sources prefixed with &quot;DBI:ODBC&quot; instead of &quot;dbi:ODBC&quot;.</p>
<p>If you don't have at least DBI 1.21 it is now a fatal error instead of
just a warning.</p>
<p>DBI-&gt;connect changed so informational diagnostics like &quot;Changed
database context to 'master'&quot; from SQL Server are available in
errstr/state. These don't cause DBI-&gt;connect to die but you can test
$h-&gt;err eq &quot;&quot; after connect and obtain the informational diagnostics
from errstr/state if you want them.</p>
<p>Fixed problem in 41Unicode.t where utf8 was used before testing we had
a recent enough Perl - thank you cpan testers.</p>
<p>Changed &quot;our&quot; back to &quot;my&quot; in Makefile.PL - thank you cpan testers.</p>
<p>Removed all calls to DBIh_EVENT2 in dbdimp.c as it is no longer used
(see posts on dbi-dev).</p>
<p>Changed text output when a driver manager is not found to stop
referring to iodbcsrc which is no longer included with DBD::ODBC.</p>
<p>Changed Makefile.PL to attempt to find unixODBC if -o or ODBCHOME not
specified.</p>
<p>Updated META.yml based on new 1.2 spec.</p>
<p>Changed Makefile.PL so if an ODBC driver manager is not found then we
issue warning and exit cleanly but not generating a Makefile. This
should stop cpan-testers from flagging a fail because they haven't got
an ODBC driver manager.</p>
<p>Changed Makefile.PL so it no longer &quot;use&quot;s DBI/DBI::DBD because this
makes cpan-testers log a fail if DBI is not installed. Changed to put
the DBI::DBD use in the CONFIGURE sub so PREREQ_PM will filter out
machines where DBI is not installed.</p>
<p>Fix a possible typo, used once in 10handler.t.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_1_15_1_november_6__2007">Changes in DBD::ODBC 1.15_1 November 6, 2007</a></h2>
<p>Minor changes to 20SqlServer.t test for SQL Server 2008 (Katmai).
Timestamps now return an extra 4 digits of precision (all 0000) and
the driver reported in dbcc messages has a '.' in the version which
was not handled.</p>
<p>New FAQ entry and test code for &quot;Datetime field overflow&quot; problem in
Oracle.</p>
<p>Changed all ODBC code to use new SQLLEN/SQLULEN types where
Microsoft's headers indicate, principally so DBD::ODBC builds and
works on win64. NOTE: you will need an ODBC Driver Manager on UNIX
which knows SQLLEN/SQLULEN types. The unixODBC driver manager uses
SQLLEN/SQLULEN in versions from at least 2.2.12. Thanks to Nelson
Oliveira for finding, patching and testing this and then fixing
problems with bound parameters on 64 bit Windows.</p>
<p>Added private_attribute_info method DBI introduced (see DBI docs)
and test cases to 02simple.t.</p>
<p>Fairly major changes to dbd_describe in dbdimp.c to reduce ODBC calls
by 1 SQLDescribeCol call per column when describing result
sets. Instead of calculating the amount of memory required to hold
every column name we work on the basis that (num_columns + 1) *
SQL_MAX_COLUMN_NAME_LEN can hold all column names. However, to avoid
using a large amount of memory unnecessarily if an ODBC driver
supports massive column name lengths the maximum size per column is
restricted to 256.</p>
<p>Changed to avoid using explicit use of DBIc_ERRXXX in favour of newish
(ok, DBD::ODBC is a bit behind the times in this respect)
DBIh_SET_ERR_CHAR.  This involved a reworking or the error handling
and although all test cases still pass I cannot guarantee it has no
other effects - please let me know if you spot differences in error
messages.</p>
<p>Fixed bug in 20SqlServer test for multiple results that was passing
but for the wrong reason (namely, that the odbc_err_handler was being
called when it should not have been).</p>
<p>Fixed bug in odbc_err_handler that prevented it from being reset so
you don't have an error handler. Looks like the problem was in
dbd_db_STORE_attrib where &quot;if(valuesv == &amp;PL_sv_undef)&quot; was used to
detect undef and I think it should be &quot;if (!SvOK(valuesv))&quot;.</p>
<p>Improvements to odbc_err_handler documentation.</p>
<p>Added 10handler.t test cases.</p>
<p>More tests in 02simple.t to check NUM_OF_FIELDS and NAMES_uc.</p>
<p>Bit of a tidy up:</p>
<p>Removed some unused variable declarations from dbdimp.c.</p>
<p>Lots of changes to DBD::ODBC tracing, particularly in dbd_describe,
and dbd_error2 and login6.</p>
<p>Removed a lot of tracing code in comments or #if 0 as it never gets
built.</p>
<p>Changed dual tests on SQL_SUCCESS and SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO to use
SQL_SUCCEEDED.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_1_14_july_17__2007">Changes in DBD::ODBC 1.14 July 17, 2007</a></h2>
<p>Fix bug reported where ping crashes after disconnect thanks to Steffen
Goeldner.</p>
<p>Fix bug in dbd_bind_ph which leads to the error Can't change param 1
maxlen (51-&gt;50) after first bind in the 20SqlServer test. This is
caused by svGROW in Perl 5.8.8 being changed to possibly grow by more
than you asked (e.g. up to the next longword boundary).</p>
<p>Fix problem with binding undef as an output parameter. Reported by
Stephen More with IBM's ODBC driver for iSeries.</p>
<p>Removed comment delimiters in comments in dbdimp.h leading to warnings.</p>
<p>Removed some unused variable declarations leading to warnings.</p>
<p>Removed PerlIO_flush calls as it is believed they are not required.</p>
<p>Add logging for whether SQLDescribeParam is supported.</p>
<p>Fixed use of unitialised variable in dbd_bind_ph where an undef is
bound and tracing is enabled.</p>
<p>Fixed issue with TRACESTATUS change in 20SqlServer.t tests 28, 31, 32
and 33 leading to those tests failing when testing with SQL Server
2005 or Express.</p>
<p>Many compiler warnings fixed - especially for incompatible types.</p>
<p>Add provisional Unicode support - thanks to Alexander Foken. This
change is very experimental (especially on UNIX). Please see ODBC.pm
documentation. Also see README.unicode and README.af. New database
attribute odbc_has_unicode to test if DBD::ODBC was built with UNICODE
support. New tests for Unicode. New requirement for Perl 5.8.1 if
Unicode support required. New -[no]u argument to Makefile.PL. New
warning in Makefile.PL if Unicode support built for UNIX.</p>
<p>Fix use of unitialised var in Makefile.PL.</p>
<p>Fix use of scalar with no effect on Makefile.PL</p>
<p>Added warning to Makefile.PL about building/running with LANG using
UTF8.</p>
<p>Added warning to Makefile.PL about using thread-safe ODBC drivers.</p>
<p>Updated MANIFEST to include more test code from mytest and remove
MANIFEST.SKIP etc.</p>
<p>Removed calls to get ODBC errors when SQLMoreResults returns SQL_NO_DATA.
These are a waste of time since SQL_NO_DATA is expected and there is no
error diagnostic to retrieve.</p>
<p>Changes to test 17 of 02simple.t which got &quot;not ok 17 - Col count
matches correct col count&quot; errors with some Postgres ODBC
drivers. Caused by test expecting column names to come back
uppercase. Fixes by uppercasing returned column names.</p>
<p>Changes to tests in 03batt.t which correctly expects an ODBC 3 driver
to return the column names in SQLTables result-set as per ODBC 3.0
spec. Postgres which reports itself as an ODBC 3.0 driver seems to
return the ODBC 2 defined column names. Changed tests to catch ODBC
2.0 names are pass test put issue warning.</p>
<p>For postgres skip test (with warning) checking $sth-&gt;{NAME} returns
empty listafter execute on update</p>
<p>Updated FAQ, added a few more questions etc.</p>
<p>DBD::ODBC requires at least 5.6.0 of Perl.</p>
<p>Many updates to pod documentation.</p>
<p>Removed some dead HTTP links in the pod I could not find equivalents for -
  let me know if you have working replacements for ones removed</p>
<p>Add some HTTP links to useful tutorials on DBD::ODBC</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_1_13_november_8__2004">Changes in DBD::ODBC 1.13 November 8, 2004</a></h2>
<p>Fix inconsistency/bug with odbc_exec_direct vs. odbc_execdirect settings.  Now made consistent with
odbc_exec_direct.  For now, will still look for odbc_execdirect in prepare, but not as DBH attribute
as a backup (which is what it was doing), but that support will be dropped at some time in the future. 
Please use odbc_exec_direct from now on...</p>
<p>Fix handling of print statements for SQL Server thanks to Martin Evans!  Thanks for all your work on this! 
Due to bug in SQL Server, you must use odbc_exec_direct.  See t/20SqlServer.t for example.  You will need
to call $sth-&gt;{odbc_more_results} to clear out any trailing messages.</p>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.45_5 July 23, 2002</pre>
<p>Added odbc_err_handler and odbc_async_exec thanks to patches by David L. Good.
See example in mytest/testerrhandler.pl</p>
<p>Here's the notes about it:</p>
<pre>
 I've implemented two separate functions.  The first is an &quot;error
 handler&quot; similar to that in DBD::Sybase.  The error handler can be used
 to intercept error and status messages from the server.  It is the only
 way (at least currently) that you can retrieve non-error status messages
 when execution is successful.</pre>
<pre>
 To use the error handler, set the &quot;odbc_err_handler&quot; attribute on
 your database handle to a reference to a subroutine that will act
 as the error handler.  This subroutine will be passed two args, the
 SQLSTATE and the error message.  If the subroutine returns 0, the
 error message will be otherwise ignored.  If it returns non-zero,
 the error message will be processed normally.</pre>
<pre>
 The second function implemented is asynchronous execution.  It's only
 useful for retrieving server messages with an error handler during an
 execute() that takes a long time (such as a DBCC on a large database) ODBC
 doesn't have the concept of a callback routine like Sybase's DBlib/CTlib
 does, so asynchronous execution is needed to be able to get the server
 messages before the SQL statement is done processing.</pre>
<pre>
 To use asynchronous execution, set the &quot;odbc_async_exec&quot; attribute on
 your database handle to 1.  Not all ODBC drivers support asynchronous
 execution.  To see if yours does, set odbc_async_exec to 1 and then check
 it's value.  If the value is 1, your ODBC driver can do asynchronous
 execution.  If the value is 0, your ODBC driver cannot.</pre>

<p>Further fixed build for ODBC 2.x drivers.  The new SQLExecDirect

Sigh.  I should have caught that the first time.  Signed, the Mad-and-

<p>Additionally, a random core dump occurred in the tests, based upon the
new SQLExecDirect code.  This has been fixed.</p>

<p>Fixed build for ODBC 2.x drivers.  The new SQLExecDirect code

<pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.35 February 9, 2002</pre>
<p>Fixed (finally) multiple result sets with differing
numbers of columns.  The final fix was to call
SQLFreeStmt(SQL_UNBIND) before repreparing
the statement for the next query.</p>
<p>Added more to the multi-statement tests to ensure
the data retrieved was what was expected.</p>
<p>Now, DBD::ODBC overrides DBI's do to call SQLExecDirect
for simple statements (those without parameters).
Please advise if you run into problems.  Hopefully,
this will provide some small speed improvement for
simple &quot;do&quot; statements.  You can also call
$dbh-&gt;func($stmt, ExecDirect).  I'm not sure this has
great value unless you need to ensure SQLExecDirect
is being called.  Patches thanks to Merijn Broeren.
Thanks Merijn!</p>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.33_3 February 4, 2002</pre>
<p>Revamped tests to include tests for multiple result sets.
The tests are ODBC driver platform specific and will be skipped
for drivers which do not support multiple result sets.</p>
<pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.33_2 February 4, 2002</pre>
<p>Finally tested new binding techniques with SQL Server 2000,
but there is a nice little bug in their MDAC and ODBC
drivers according to the knowledge base article # Q273813, titled</p>
<pre>
   &quot;FIX: &quot;Incorrect Syntax near the Keyword 'by' &quot;
   Error Message with Column Names of &quot;C&quot;, &quot;CA&quot; or &quot;CAS&quot; (Q273813)</pre>
<p>DBD::ODBC now does not name any of the columns A, B, C, or D
they are now COL_A, COL_B, COL_C, COL_D.</p>
<pre>
 *** NOTE: *** I AM STRONGLY CONSIDERING MAKING THE NEW
 BINDING the default for future versions.  I do not believe
 it will break much existing code (if any) as anyone binding
 to non VARCHAR (without the ODBC driver doing a good conversion
 from the VARCHAR) will have a problem.  It may be subtle, however,
 since much code will work, but say, binding dates may not with
 some drivers.
   
 Please comment soon...
   
=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.33_1 February 4, 2002</pre>
<p>*** WARNING: ***</p>
<pre>

 Changes to the binding code to allow the use of SQLDescribeParam
 to determine if the type of column being bound.  This is
 experimental and activated by setting</pre>
<pre>

  <span class="variable">$dbh</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="string">odbc_default_bind_type</span><span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="number">0</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="comment"># before creating the query...</span>
</pre>
<p>Currently the default value of odbc_default_bind_type = SQL_VARCHAR
which mimicks the current behavior.  If you set
odbc_default_bind_type to 0, then SQLDescribeParam will be
called to determine the columen type.  Not ALL databases
handle this correctly.  For example, Oracle returns
SQL_VARCHAR for all types and attempts to convert to the
correct type for us.  However, if you use the ODBC escaped
date/time format such as: {ts '1998-05-13 00:01:00'} then
Oracle complains.  If you bind this with a SQL_TIMESTAMP type,
however, Oracle's ODBC driver will parse the time/date correctly.
Use at your own risk!</p>
<p>Fix to dbdimp.c to allow quoted identifiers to begin/end
with either &quot; or '.
The following will not be treated as if they have a bind placeholder:</p>
<pre>
   &quot;isEstimated?&quot;
   '01-JAN-1987 00:00:00'
   'Does anyone insert a ?'</pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.32 January 22, 2002</pre>
<p>More SAP patches to Makfile.PL to eliminate the call to Data Sources</p>
<p>A patch to the test (for SAP and potentially others), to allow
fallback to SQL_TYPE_DATE in the tests</p>
<pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.31 January 18, 2002</pre>
<p>Added SAP patches to build directly against SAP driver instead of
driver manager thanks to Flemming Frandsen (thanks!)</p>
<p>Added support to fix ping for Oracle8.  May break other databases,
so please report this as soon as possible.  The downside is that
we need to actually execute the dummy query.</p>

<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_0_30_january_8__2002">Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.30 January 8, 2002</a></h2>
<p>Added ping patch for Solid courtesy of Marko Asplund</p>
<p>Updated disconnect to rollback if autocommit is not on.
This should silence some errors when disconnecting.</p>
<p>Updated SQL_ROWSET_SIZE attribute.  Needed to force it to
odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE to obey the DBI rules.</p>
<p>Added odbc_SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER, which obtains the version of
the Driver upon connect.  This internal capture of the version is
a read-only attributed and is used during array binding of parameters.</p>
<pre>

Added odbc_ignore_named_placeholders attribute to facilicate
creating triggers within SAPDB and Oracle, to name two. The
syntax in these DBs is to allow use of :old and :new to
access column values before and after updates.  Example:</pre>
<pre>
 <span class="variable">$dbh</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="string">odbc_ignore_named_placeholders</span><span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="number">1</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="comment"># set it for all future statements</span>
                                          <span class="comment"># ignores :foo, :new, etc, but not :1 or ?</span>

SQL_ROWSET_SIZE attribute patch from Andrew Brown</pre>
<pre>
 There are only 2 additional lines allowing for the setting of
 SQL_ROWSET_SIZE as db handle option.</pre>
<pre>
 The purpose to my madness is simple. SqlServer (7 anyway) by default
 supports only one select statement at once (using std ODBC cursors).
 According to the SqlServer documentation you can alter the default setting
 of
 three values to force the use of server cursors - in which case multiple
 selects are possible.</pre>
<pre>
 <span class="variable">The</span> <span class="variable">code</span> <span class="variable">change</span> <span class="variable">allows</span> <span class="keyword">for</span><span class="operator">:</span>
 <span class="variable">$dbh</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="string">SQL_ROWSET_SIZE</span><span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="number">2</span><span class="operator">;</span>    <span class="comment"># Any value &gt; 1</span>
</pre>
<pre>
 For this very purpose.</pre>
<pre>
 The setting of SQL_ROWSET_SIZE only affects the extended fetch command as
 far as I can work out and thus setting this option shouldn't affect
 DBD::ODBC operations directly in any way.</pre>

<p>VMS and other patches from Martin Evans (thanks!)</p>
<p>[1] a fix for Makefile.PL to build DBD::ODBC on OpenVMS.</p>
<p>[2] fix trace message coredumping after SQLDriverConnect</p>
<p>[3] fix call to SQLCancel which fails to pass the statement handle properly.</p>
<p>[4] consume diagnostics after SQLDriverConnect/SQLConnect call or they remain
    until the next error occurs and it then looks confusing (this is due to
    ODBC spec for SQLError). e.g. test 02simple returns a data truncated error
    only now instead of all the informational diags that are left from the
    connect call, like the &quot;database changed&quot;, &quot;language changed&quot; messages you
    get from MS SQL Server.</p>
<p>Replaced C++ style comments with C style to support more platforms more easily.</p>
<p>Fixed bug which use the single quote (') instead of a double quote (&quot;) for &quot;literal&quot; column names.  This
   helped when having a colon (:) in the column name.</p>
<p>Fixed bug which would cause DBD::ODBC to core-dump (crash) if DBI tracing level was greater than 3.</p>
<p>Fixed problem where ODBC.pm would have &quot;use of uninitialized variable&quot; if calling DBI's type_info.</p>
<p>Fixed problem where ODBC.xs *may* have an overrun when calling SQLDataSources.</p>
<p>Fixed problem with DBI 1.14, where fprintf was being called instead of PerlIO_printf for debug information</p>
<p>Fixed problem building with unixODBC per patch from Nick Gorham</p>
<p>Added ability to <code>bind_param_inout()</code> via patches from Jeremy Cooper.  Haven't figured out a good, non-db specific
   way to test.  My current test platform attempts to determine the connected database type via
   ugly hacks and will test, if it thinks it can.  Feel free to patch and send me something...Also, my
   current Oracle ODBC driver fails miserably and dies.</p>
<p>Updated t/02simple.t to not print an error, when there is not one.</p>
<pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.28 March 23, 2000</pre>
<p>Added support for SQLSpecialColumns thanks to patch provided by Martin J. Evans <a href="mailto:[martin@easysoft.com]">[martin@easysoft.com]</a></p>
<p>Fixed bug introduced in 0.26 which was introduced of SQLMoreResults was not supported by the driver.</p>

<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_0_27_march_8__2000">Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.27 March 8, 2000</a></h2>
<p>Examined patch for ping method to repair problem reported by Chris Bezil.  Thanks Chris!</p>
<p>Added simple test for ping method working which should identify this in the future.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_0_26_march_5__2000">Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.26 March 5, 2000</a></h2>
<p>Put in patch for returning only positive rowcounts from dbd_st_execute.  The original patch
was submitted by Jon Smirl and put back in by David Good.  Reasoning seems sound, so I put it
back in.  However, any databases that return negative rowcounts for specific reasons,
will no longer do so.</p>
<p>Put in David Good's patch for multiple result sets.  Thanks David!  See mytest\moreresults.pl for
an example of usage.</p>
<p>Added readme.txt in iodbcsrc explaining an issue there with iODBC 2.50.3 and <code>data_sources</code>.</p>
<p>Put in rudimentary cancel support via SQLCancel.  Call $sth-&gt;cencel to utilize.  However, it is largely
untested by me, as I do not have a good sample for this yet.  It may come in handy with threaded
perl, someday or it may work in a signal handler.</p>
<pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.25 March 4, 2000</pre>
<p>Added conditional compilation for SQL_WVARCHAR and SQL_WLONGVARCHAR.  If they
are not defined by your driver manager, they will not be compiled in to the code.
If you would like to support these types on some platforms, you may be able to
#define SQL_WVARCHAR (-9)
#define SQL_WLONGVARCHAR (-10)</p>
<p>Added more long tests with binding in t\09bind.t.  Note use of bind_param!</p>
<pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.24 February 24, 2000</pre>
<p>Fixed Test #13 in 02simple.t.  Would fail, improperly, if there was only one data source defined.</p>
<p>Fixed (hopefully) SQL Server 7 and ntext type &quot;Out of Memory!&quot; errors via patch from Thomas Lowery.  Thanks Thomas!</p>
<p>Added more support for Solid to handle the fact that it does not support data_sources nor SQLDriverConnect.
Patch supplied by Samuli Karkkainen <a href="mailto:[skarkkai@woods.iki.fi].">[skarkkai@woods.iki.fi].</a>  Thanks!  It's untested by me, however.</p>
<p>Added some information from Adam Curtin about a bug in iodbc 2.50.3's data_sources.  See
iodbcsrc\readme.txt.</p>
<p>Added information in this pod from Stephen Arehart regarding DSNLess connections.</p>
<p>Added fix for sp_prepare/sp_execute bug reported by Paul G. Weiss.</p>
<p>Added some code for handling a hint on disconnect where the user gets an error for not committing.</p>
<pre>

=head2 Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.22 September 8, 1999</pre>
<p>Fixed for threaded perl builds.  Note that this was tested only on Win32, with no threads in use and using DBI 1.13.
Note, for ActiveState/PERL_OBJECT builds, DBI 1.13_01 is required as of 9/8/99.  
If you are using ActiveState's perl, this can be installed by using PPM.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_0_21">Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.21</a></h2>
<p>Thanks to all who provided patches!</p>
<p>Added ability to connect to an ODBC source without prior creation of DSN.  See mytest/contest.pl for example with MS Access.
(Also note that you will need documentation for your ODBC driver -- which, sadly, can be difficult to find).</p>
<p>Fixed case sensitivity in tests.</p>
<p>Hopefully fixed test #4 in t/09bind.t.  Updated it to insert the date column and updated it to find the right
type of the column.  However, it doesn't seem to work on my Linux test machine, using the OpenLink drivers 
with MS-SQL Server (6.5).  It complains about binding the date time.  The same test works under Win32 with 
SQL Server 6.5, Oracle 8.0.3 and MS Access 97 ODBC drivers.  Hmmph.</p>
<p>Fixed some binary type issues (patches from Jon Smirl)</p>
<p>Added SQLStatistics, SQLForeignKeys, SQLPrimaryKeys (patches from Jon Smirl)
Thanks (again), Jon, for providing the build_results function to help reduce duplicate code!</p>
<p>Worked on LongTruncOk for Openlink drivers.</p>
<p>Note: those trying to bind variables need to remember that you should use the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
        <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">DBI</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="operator">...</span>
        <span class="variable">$sth</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="variable">bind_param</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="number">1</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="variable">$str</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="variable">DBI::SQL_LONGVARCHAR</span><span class="operator">);</span>
</pre>
<p>Added support for unixodbc (per Nick Gorham)
Added support for OpenLinks udbc (per Patrick van Kleef)
Added Support for esodbc (per Martin Evans)
Added Support for Easysoft (per Bob Kline)</p>
<p>Changed table_info to produce a list of views, too.
Fixed bug in SQLColumns call.
Fixed blob handling via patches from Jochen Wiedmann.
Added data_sources capability via snarfing code from DBD::Adabas (Jochen Wiedmann)</p>

</p>
<h2><a name="changes_in_dbd__odbc_0_17">Changes in DBD::ODBC 0.17</a></h2>
<p>This release is mostly due to the good work of Jeff Urlwin.
My eternal thanks to you Jeff.</p>
<p>Fixed &quot;SQLNumResultCols err&quot; on joins and 'order by' with some
drivers (see Microsoft Knowledge Base article #Q124899).
Thanks to Paul O'Fallon for that one.</p>
<p>Added more (probably incomplete) support for unix ODBC in Makefile.PL</p>
<p>Increased default SQL_COLUMN_DISPLAY_SIZE and SQL_COLUMN_LENGTH to 2000
for drivers that don't provide a way to query them dynamically. Was 100!</p>
<p>When fetch reaches the end-of-data it automatically frees the internal
ODBC statement handle and marks the DBI statement handle as inactive
(thus an explicit 'finish' is *not* required).</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>LongTruncOk for Oracle ODBC (where fbh-&gt;datalen &lt; 0)</p>
<p>Added tracing into SQLBindParameter (help diagnose oracle odbc bug)</p>
<p>Fixed/worked around bug/result from Latest Oracle ODBC driver where in
SQLColAttribute cbInfoValue was changed to 0 to indicate fDesc had a value</p>
<p>Added work around for compiling w/ActiveState PRK (PERL_OBJECT)</p>
<p>Updated tests to include date insert and type</p>
<p>Added more &quot;backup&quot; SQL_xxx types for tests</p>
<p>Updated bind test to test binding select</p>
<pre>
 NOTE: bind insert fails on Paradox driver (don't know why)

</pre>
<p>Added support for: (see notes below)</p>
<pre>
  SQLGetInfo       via $dbh-&gt;func(xxx, GetInfo)
  SQLGetTypeInfo   via $dbh-&gt;func(xxx, GetTypeInfo)
  SQLDescribeCol   via $sth-&gt;func(colno, DescribeCol)
  SQLColAttributes via $sth-&gt;func(xxx, colno, ColAttributes)
  SQLGetFunctions  via $dbh-&gt;func(xxx, GetFunctions)
  SQLColumns       via $dbh-&gt;func(catalog, schema, table, column, 'columns')

</pre>
<p>Fixed $DBI::err to reflect the real ODBC error code
which is a 5 char code, not necessarily numeric.</p>
<p>Fixed fetches when LongTruncOk == 1.</p>
<p>Updated tests to pass more often (hopefully 100% &lt;G&gt;)</p>
<p>Updated tests to test long reading, inserting and the LongTruncOk attribute.</p>
<p>Updated tests to be less driver specific.</p>
<p>They now rely upon SQLGetTypeInfo <em>heavily</em> in order to create the tables.
The test use this function to &quot;ask&quot; the driver for the name of the SQL type
to correctly create long, varchar, etc types.  For example, in Oracle the
SQL_VARCHAR type is VARCHAR2, while MS Access uses TEXT for the SQL Name.  
Again, in Oracle the SQL_LONGVARCHAR is LONG, while in Access it's MEMO.
The tests currently handle this correctly (at least with Access and Oracle,
MS SQL server will be tested also).</p>
