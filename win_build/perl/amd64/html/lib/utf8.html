<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>The <code>use utf8</code> pragma tells the Perl parser to allow UTF-8 in the
program text in the current lexical scope (allow UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based
platforms).  The <code>no utf8</code> pragma tells Perl to switch back to treating
the source text as literal bytes in the current lexical scope.</p>
<p><strong>Do not use this pragma for anything else than telling Perl that your
script is written in UTF-8.</strong> The utility functions described below are
directly usable without <code>use utf8;</code>.</p>
<p>Because it is not possible to reliably tell UTF-8 from native 8 bit
encodings, you need either a Byte Order Mark at the beginning of your
source code, or <code>use utf8;</code>, to instruct perl.</p>
<p>When UTF-8 becomes the standard source format, this pragma will
effectively become a no-op.  For convenience in what follows the term
<em>UTF-X</em> is used to refer to UTF-8 on ASCII and ISO Latin based
platforms and UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms.</p>
<p>See also the effects of the <code>-C</code> switch and its cousin, the
<code>$ENV{PERL_UNICODE}</code>, in <a href="../lib/pods/perlrun.html">the perlrun manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Enabling the <a href="../lib/pods/perlrun.html#utf8"><code>utf8</code></a> pragma has the following effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bytes in the source text that have their high-bit set will be treated
as being part of a literal UTF-X sequence.  This includes most
literals such as identifier names, string constants, and constant
regular expression patterns.</p>
<p>On EBCDIC platforms characters in the Latin 1 character set are
treated as being part of a literal UTF-EBCDIC character.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if you have bytes with the eighth bit on in your script
(for example embedded Latin-1 in your string literals), <code>use utf8</code>
will be unhappy since the bytes are most probably not well-formed
UTF-X.  If you want to have such bytes under <code>use utf8</code>, you can disable
this pragma until the end the block (or file, if at top level) by
<code>no utf8;</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="utility_functions">Utility functions</a></h2>
<p>The following functions are defined in the <a href="../lib/pods/perlrun.html#utf8"><code>utf8::</code></a> package by the
Perl core.  You do not need to say <code>use utf8</code> to use these and in fact
you should not say that  unless you really want to have UTF-8 source code.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="upgrade" class="item">$num_octets = utf8::upgrade($string)</a></strong>

<p>Converts in-place the internal octet sequence in the native encoding
(Latin-1 or EBCDIC) to the equivalent character sequence in <em>UTF-X</em>.
<em>$string</em> already encoded as characters does no harm.  Returns the
number of octets necessary to represent the string as <em>UTF-X</em>.  Can be
used to make sure that the UTF-8 flag is on, so that <a href="../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\w</code></a> or <a href="../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lc"><code>lc()</code></a>
work as Unicode on strings containing characters in the range 0x80-0xFF
(on ASCII and derivatives).</p>
<p><strong>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</strong>
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
<a href="../lib/Encode.html">the Encode manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="downgrade" class="item">$success = utf8::downgrade($string[, FAIL_OK])</a></strong>

<p>Converts in-place the internal octet sequence in <em>UTF-X</em> to the
equivalent octet sequence in the native encoding (Latin-1 or EBCDIC).
<em>$string</em> already encoded as native 8 bit does no harm.  Can be used to
make sure that the UTF-8 flag is off, e.g. when you want to make sure
that the <a href="../lib/pods/perlvar.html#substr"><code>substr()</code></a> or <a href="../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#length"><code>length()</code></a> function works with the usually faster
byte algorithm.</p>
<p>Fails if the original <em>UTF-X</em> sequence cannot be represented in the
native 8 bit encoding. On failure dies or, if the value of <code>FAIL_OK</code> is
true, returns false.</p>
<p>Returns true on success.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</strong>
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
<a href="../lib/Encode.html">the Encode manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="encode" class="item">utf8::encode($string)</a></strong>

<p>Converts in-place the character sequence to the corresponding octet
sequence in <em>UTF-X</em>.  The UTF8 flag is turned off, so that after this
operation, the string is a byte string.  Returns nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</strong>
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
<a href="../lib/Encode.html">the Encode manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="decode" class="item">$success = utf8::decode($string)</a></strong>

<p>Attempts to convert in-place the octet sequence in <em>UTF-X</em> to the
corresponding character sequence.  The UTF-8 flag is turned on only if
the source string contains multiple-byte <em>UTF-X</em> characters.  If
<em>$string</em> is invalid as <em>UTF-X</em>, returns false; otherwise returns
true.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</strong>
Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also
<a href="../lib/Encode.html">the Encode manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="is_utf8" class="item">$flag = utf8::is_utf8(STRING)</a></strong>

<p>(Since Perl 5.8.1)  Test whether STRING is in UTF-8 internally.
Functionally the same as Encode::is_utf8().</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="valid" class="item">$flag = utf8::valid(STRING)</a></strong>

<p>[INTERNAL] Test whether STRING is in a consistent state regarding
UTF-8.  Will return true is well-formed UTF-8 and has the UTF-8 flag
on <strong>or</strong> if string is held as bytes (both these states are 'consistent').
Main reason for this routine is to allow Perl's testsuite to check
that operations have left strings in a consistent state.  You most
probably want to use utf8::is_utf8() instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>utf8::encode</code> is like <code>utf8::upgrade</code>, but the UTF8 flag is
cleared.  See <a href="../lib/pods/perlunicode.html">the perlunicode manpage</a> for more on the UTF8 flag and the C API
functions <code>sv_utf8_upgrade</code>, <code>sv_utf8_downgrade</code>, <code>sv_utf8_encode</code>,
and <code>sv_utf8_decode</code>, which are wrapped by the Perl functions
<code>utf8::upgrade</code>, <code>utf8::downgrade</code>, <code>utf8::encode</code> and
<code>utf8::decode</code>.  Also, the functions utf8::is_utf8, utf8::valid,
utf8::encode, utf8::decode, utf8::upgrade, and utf8::downgrade are
actually internal, and thus always available, without a <code>require utf8</code>
statement.</p>

<hr />
<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or
subroutine names.  While some limited functionality towards this does
exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of
Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.</p>
<p>One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent
unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may need
to be mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode capability of
the filesystem becomes important-- and there unfortunately aren't
portable answers.</p>
