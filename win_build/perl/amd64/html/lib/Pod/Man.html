<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Pod::Man is a module to convert documentation in the POD format (the
preferred language for documenting Perl) into *roff input using the man
macro set.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a terminal
using <em>nroff(1)</em>, normally via <em>man(1)</em>, or printing using <em>troff(1)</em>.
It is conventionally invoked using the driver script <strong>pod2man</strong>, but it can
also be used directly.</p>
<p>As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods and
interfaces.  See <a href="../../lib/Pod/Simple.html">the Pod::Simple manpage</a> for all the details.</p>
<p><code>new()</code> can take options, in the form of key/value pairs that control the
behavior of the parser.  See below for details.</p>
<p>If no options are given, Pod::Man uses the name of the input file with any
trailing <code>.pod</code>, <code>.pm</code>, or <code>.pl</code> stripped as the man page title, to
section 1 unless the file ended in <code>.pm</code> in which case it defaults to
section 3, to a centered title of &quot;User Contributed Perl Documentation&quot;, to
a centered footer of the Perl version it is run with, and to a left-hand
footer of the modification date of its input (or the current date if given
STDIN for input).</p>
<p>Pod::Man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font named
CW.  If yours is called something else (like CR), use the <a href="#fixed"><code>fixed</code></a> option to
specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for printing.
Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and bold italic
fixed-width output.</p>
<p>Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man also takes care of formatting
<code>func()</code>, <code>func(3)</code>, and simple variable references like $foo or @bar so you
don't have to use code escapes for them; complex expressions like
<code>$fred{'stuff'}</code> will still need to be escaped, though.  It also translates
dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes long dashes--like
this--into proper em dashes, fixes &quot;paired quotes,&quot; makes C++ look right,
puts a little space between double underbars, makes ALLCAPS a teeny bit
smaller in <strong>troff</strong>, and escapes stuff that *roff treats as special so that
you don't have to.</p>
<p>The recognized options to <code>new()</code> are as follows.  All options take a single
argument.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="center" class="item">center</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Sets the centered page header to use instead of &quot;User Contributed Perl
Documentation&quot;.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="date" class="item">date</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Sets the left-hand footer.  By default, the modification date of the input
file will be used, or the current date if <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#stat"><code>stat()</code></a> can't find that file (the
case if the input is from STDIN), and the date will be formatted as
YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="fixed" class="item">fixed</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>The fixed-width font to use for vertabim text and code.  Defaults to CW.
Some systems may want CR instead.  Only matters for <strong>troff</strong> output.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="fixedbold" class="item">fixedbold</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to CB.  Only matters for
<strong>troff</strong> output.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="fixeditalic" class="item">fixeditalic</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer,
since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic
version).  Defaults to CI.  Only matters for <strong>troff</strong> output.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="fixedbolditalic" class="item">fixedbolditalic</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.
Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to CB.  Some systems
(such as Solaris) have this font available as CX.  Only matters for <strong>troff</strong>
output.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="name" class="item">name</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set the name of the manual page.  Without this option, the manual name is
set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless the
manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl
module path.  If it is, a path like <code>.../lib/Pod/Man.pm</code> is converted into
a name like <code>Pod::Man</code>.  This option, if given, overrides any automatic
determination of the name.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="quotes" class="item">quotes</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text.  If the value is a
single character, it is used as both the left and right quote; if it is two
characters, the first character is used as the left quote and the second as
the right quoted; and if it is four characters, the first two are used as
the left quote and the second two as the right quote.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This may also be set to the special value <code>none</code>, in which case no quote
marks are added around C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff
output).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="release" class="item">release</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run
Pod::Man under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume that the
centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend something like
&quot;Last modified: &quot;; if this is the case, you may want to set <a href="#release"><code>release</code></a> to
the last modified date and <a href="#date"><code>date</code></a> to the version number.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="section" class="item">section</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set the section for the <code>.TH</code> macro.  The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot
of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file
formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.  Still others
use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers
that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in .pm in which case
section 3 will be selected.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>The standard Pod::Simple method <code>parse_file()</code> takes one argument naming the
POD file to read from.  By default, the output is sent to STDOUT, but this
can be changed with the <code>output_fd()</code> method.</p>
<p>The standard Pod::Simple method <code>parse_from_file()</code> takes up to two
arguments, the first being the input file to read POD from and the second
being the file to write the formatted output to.</p>
<p>You can also call <code>parse_lines()</code> to parse an array of lines or
<code>parse_string_document()</code> to parse a document already in memory.  To put the
output into a string instead of a file handle, call the <code>output_string()</code>
method.  See <a href="../../lib/Pod/Simple.html">the Pod::Simple manpage</a> for the specific details.</p>

<hr />
<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>Eight-bit input data isn't handled at all well at present.  The correct
approach would be to map E&lt;&gt; escapes to the appropriate UTF-8
characters and then do a translation pass on the output according to the
user-specified output character set.  Unfortunately, we can't send eight-bit
data directly to the output unless the user says this is okay, since some
vendor *roff implementations can't handle eight-bit data.  If the *roff
implementation can, however, that's far superior to the current hacked
characters that only work under troff.</p>
<p>There is currently no way to turn off the guesswork that tries to format
unmarked text appropriately, and sometimes it isn't wanted (particularly
when using POD to document something other than Perl).  Most of the work
towards fixing this has now been done, however, and all that's still needed
is a user interface.</p>
<p>The NAME section should be recognized specially and index entries emitted
for everything in that section.  This would have to be deferred until the
next section, since extraneous things in NAME tends to confuse various man
page processors.  Currently, no index entries are emitted for anything in
NAME.</p>
<p>Pod::Man doesn't handle font names longer than two characters.  Neither do
most <strong>troff</strong> implementations, but GNU troff does as an extension.  It would
be nice to support as an option for those who want to use it.</p>
<p>The preamble added to each output file is rather verbose, and most of it
is only necessary in the presence of non-ASCII characters.  It would
ideally be nice if all of those definitions were only output if needed,
perhaps on the fly as the characters are used.</p>
<p>Pod::Man is excessively slow.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="caveats">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p>The handling of hyphens and em dashes is somewhat fragile, and one may get
the wrong one under some circumstances.  This should only matter for
<strong>troff</strong> output.</p>
<p>When and whether to use small caps is somewhat tricky, and Pod::Man doesn't
necessarily get it right.</p>
<p>Converting neutral double quotes to properly matched double quotes doesn't
work unless there are no formatting codes between the quote marks.  This
only matters for troff output.</p>
