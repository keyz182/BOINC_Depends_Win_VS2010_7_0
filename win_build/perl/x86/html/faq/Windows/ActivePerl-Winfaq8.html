<p>ActivePerl-faq8 - General programming</p>
 
<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p>General programming questions about ActivePerl</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_change_the_Win32_Regist">How do I change the Win32
Registry?</a></h2>
<p>There are several Win32 Registry functions provided with ActivePerl. Check
the win32mod document provided with ActivePerl.</p>
<p>If you don't understand how the Registry works, remember that a Registry <em>key</em>
is like a directory, and a Registry <em>value</em> is like a file. There are
several <em>top level keys</em>, and these are kind of like drives.</p>
<p>If you really don't fully understand the Registry, it's probably in your best
interest not to mess around with it.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_read_from_write_to_a_na">How do I read from/write to a
named pipe?</a></h2>
<p>Named pipes are a interprocess communcations mechanism, mainly used with
Microsoft operating systems (like Win32 platforms). A named pipe can be
addressed just like a file.</p>
<p>The name of a named pipe is a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) name, and
looks like <em>\\servername\pipe\pipename</em>. <code>servername</code> is the
name of the server you're connecting to, or <code>.</code> for the current
computer. <code>pipe</code> is a constant, and <code>pipename</code> is the name
of the pipe, such as sql for Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
<p>You can use <code>open(),</code> <code>close(),</code> <code>read(),</code>
and <code>print()</code> on a named pipe just like a file. However, you can't
use <code>sysread()</code> or <code>syswrite()</code> on one, because they
aren't really files.</p>
<p>There's a program called Win32Pipe on the CPAN archive that can be used to
create a named pipe.</p>
<p>If you're starting from scratch, and you have a TCP/IP infrastructure,
consider using sockets rather than named pipes for your IPC mechanism.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_write_socket_scripts_">How do I write socket scripts?</a></h2>
<p>There are several examples of socket scripts that are distributed with
ActivePerl. They're in the <em>eg</em> subdirectory of your perl directory.</p>
<p>See <a class="doc" href="#How_do_I_write_a_sockets_server_">How do I write a sockets
server in Perl for Win32?</a> for information about sockets servers.</p>
 
<h2><a name="What_s_all_this_I_hear_about_not">What's all this I hear about not
being able to use a socket as a filehandle?</a></h2>
<p>Early versions of Perl for Win32 didn't allow you to read or write to a
socket as if it were a filehandle. The current versions fully support this, and
you shouldn't worry about it too much. If the version that you're using doesn't
work well, get the latest build from ActiveState (see <a class="doc" href="../ActivePerl-faq1.html#Where_is_the_Perl_for_Win32_inte">Where
is the ActivePerl interpreter available?</a>).</p>
<p>You don't have to specify <code>USE_SOCKETS_AS_FILEHANDLES</code> when
building Perl for Win32 to get sockets to work like filehandles. It doesn't <em>hurt</em>,
but it's not necessary.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_write_a_sockets_server_">How do I write a sockets server
in Perl for Win32?</a></h2>
<p>There's an example of a socket server, TCP-SERVER, in the <em>eg</em>
directory of your perl directory. In general, information on socket programming
for UNIX is applicable to ActivePerl. See especially the perlipc page of the
documentation.</p>
<p>If you need to develop a server that can service multiple clients at once,
take a look at the IO::Select module. This module allows you to write servers
that can manage open connections from multiple clients. Individual requests on a
connection are queued up, so if your server can provide quick responses, this
approach may work well for you. Here's an example, adapted from Erik Olson's
Programming with Perl Modules (one of the volumes in O'Reilly's Win32 Perl
Resource Kit):</p>
<pre>
    use IO::Socket;
    use IO::Select;
    
    # Create a socket to listen on.
    #
    my $listener = 
      IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new( LocalPort =&gt; 8008, Listen =&gt; 5, Reuse =&gt; 1 );
    
    die &quot;Can't create socket for listening: $!&quot; unless $listener;
    print &quot;Listening for connections on port 8008\n&quot;;
    
    my $readable = IO::Select-&gt;new;     # Create a new IO::Select object
    $readable-&gt;add($listener);          # Add the listener to it
    
    while(1) {
    
        # Get a list of sockets that are ready to talk to us.
        #
        my ($ready) = IO::Select-&gt;select($readable, undef, undef, undef);
        foreach my $s (@$ready) {
            
            # Is it a new connection?
            #
            if($s == $listener) {
            
                # Accept the connection and add it to our readable list.
                #
                my $new_sock = $listener-&gt;accept;
                $readable-&gt;add($new_sock) if $new_sock;
                
                print $new_sock &quot;Welcome!\r\n&quot;;
                
            } else {  # It's an established connection
            
                my $buf = &lt;$s&gt;;   # Try to read a line
                
                # Was there anyone on the other end?
                #
                if( defined $buf ) {
                    
                    # If they said goodbye, close the socket. If not,
                    # echo what they said to us.
                    #
                    if ($buf =~ /goodbye/i) {
                        print $s &quot;See you later!\n&quot;;
                        $readable-&gt;remove($s);
                        $s-&gt;close;
                    } else {
                        print $s &quot;You said: $buf\n&quot;;
                    }
                    
                } else { # The client disconnected.
                
                    $readable-&gt;remove($s);
                    $s-&gt;close;
                    print STDERR &quot;Client Connection closed\n&quot;;
                    
                }
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>For more information, see the IO::Socket and IO::Select documentation. It is
also possible to write a multithreaded server using ActivePerl, if threads are
enabled in the version of Perl you are using. However, threading is still
somewhat experimental in Perl 5.005, so use this feature with caution.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_send_or_receive_files_FTP">How do I send or receive files by
FTP?</a></h2>
<p>See the Net::FTP module. Net::FTP is part of the libnet bundle, which is
available from CPAN, and can be installed using the Perl Package Manager (PPM).</p>
<p>Aldo Calpini has developed a ActivePerl extension to do FTP and HTTP using
the WININET library. It's in alpha testing and is available on his web page at <a class="doc" href="http://dada.perl.it/">http://</a><a class="doc" href="http://dada.perl.it">dada.perl.it/</a></p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_send_or_receive_files_HTTP">How do I send or receive files by
HTTP?</a></h2>
<p>The libwww-perl bundle (LWP) is a collection of modules for WWW access in
Perl. LWP is available from CPAN in source form, or you can install it using the
Perl Package Manager (PPM). LWP may also be included with future binary releases
of Perl.</p>
<p>Aldo Calpini has developed a ActivePerl extension to do FTP and HTTP using
the WININET library. It's in alpha testing and is available on his web page at <a class="doc" href="http://dada.perl.it">http://dada.perl.it/</a></p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_manage_user_accounts_wi">How do I manage user accounts
with ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>There's an extension called Win32::NetAdmin distributed with ActivePerl. It
has a pretty low-level interface, but it is very possible to manage users and
groups with this module.</p>
 
<h2><a name="How_do_I_read_from_and_write_to_">How do I read from and write to
serial ports?</a></h2>
<p>Serial ports can be opened just like files in ActivePerl. To open <em>COM1</em>,
just do this:</p>
<pre>
    open( PORT, &quot;+&gt;COM1&quot; ) or die &quot;Can't open COM1: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p>You should be able to read from and write to the file handle using the
standard I/O functions (read() and <code>print()),</code> but not the system
functions (sysread() and <code>syswrite()).</code></p>
<p>It has been noted (but not tested) that modems that use the Hayes command set
require a carriage return (\r) rather than a line feed (\n) at the end of the
command.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Why_doesn_t_the_d_operator_work">Why doesn't the -d operator work?</a></h2>
<p>It does, in fact, work. However, people tend to use it incorrectly and get
bad results. To check for all the subdirectories in a directory, try code like
this:</p>
<pre>
    $path = shift;
    $path = &quot;.&quot; unless $path;
    
    opendir( DIR, $path )
        or die &quot;Can't open $path: $!&quot;;
    
    while ( $entry = readdir( DIR ) ) {
        $type = ( -d &quot;$path\\$entry&quot; ) ? &quot;dir&quot; : &quot;file&quot;; # $path is crucial!
        print &quot;$type\t$entry\n&quot;;
    }
    
    closedir( DIR );
</pre>
<p>It's a common mistake to leave out the <code>$path</code> from the <code>-d</code>
check. If you do this, perl thinks you're talking about files in the current
directory. Since the dirs don't <code>-e</code> in your current directory, they
definitely don't <code>-d</code>. Exceptions are <em>.</em> and <em>..</em>,
which exist in every directory.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Reading_from_and_writing_to_file">Reading from and writing to files
mysteriously fails. What's wrong?</a></h2>
<p>On Win32 platforms, there's a big difference between text files and binary
files. For text files, the \r\n characters are translated into \n when read from
disk, and the ^Z character is read as an end-of-file marker. For binary files,
no such translation is used.</p>
<p>Although this works great for text files, it really messes things up when
you're trying to read and write binary files. If the read or write does not
abort prematurely because a ^Z was found in the file, you will almost definitely
get incorrect bytes in the file due to \n -&gt; \r\n translation.</p>
<p>The problem is that ActivePerl, and the C runtime library it uses, open file
in text mode by default. For each file handle you use in Perl for binary data,
you need to specify that the file handle is in binary mode. Fortunately, there's
a function, binmode, that does just that. See the perlfunc documentation file
for details.</p>
<p>This script copies one binary file to another. Note its use of binmode to set
the mode of the file handle.</p>
<pre>
    open( INFILE, &quot;&lt;$infile&quot; );
    open( OUTFILE, &quot;&gt;$outfile&quot; );
    
    binmode( INFILE ); binmode( OUTFILE ); # crucial for binary files!
    
    while ( read( INFILE, $buffer, 1024 ) ) {
        print OUTFILE $buffer;
    }
    
    close( INFILE ); 
    close( OUTFILE );
</pre>
 
<h2><a name="When_I_try_to_open_a_file_I_get">When I try to open a file, I get a
&quot;bad argument&quot; error.</a></h2>
<p>Win32 platforms use the '\' character as a delimiter for paths in a file name
(C:\like\this). However, Perl uses the '\' character as an escape code, to
symbolize a special character like the line feed character (\n) or the tab
character (\t).</p>
<p>So, if you try and open a file like this:</p>
<pre>
    open( MYFILE, &quot;C:\temp\newfile.txt&quot; );
</pre>
<p>you'll get an error. One solution is to replace each '\' with a double-'\',
to show that you really mean to use that character, not an escape:</p>
<pre>
   open( MYFILE, &quot;C:\\temp\\newfile.txt&quot; );
</pre>
<p>Another solution is to use non-interpolating single quote strings, which lets
Perl know not to use any special characters:</p>
<pre>
   open( MYFILE, 'C:\temp\newfile.txt' );
</pre>
<p>Finally, you can also use the / character to separate directory components in
pathnames. You must avoid using this in calls to external programs, because some
programs tend to treat / as the option-prefix instead of directory separator.
However, ActivePerl (and in fact, all of the Win32 API) understands that / is a
directory separator, so using / allows you to more easily port scripts between
UNIX and Win32:</p>
<pre>
   open( MYFILE, '/temp/newfile.txt' );
</pre>
<p>See the perlop documentation page for more information on the differences
between single quotes (') and double quotes (``).</p>
 
<h2><a name="Why_do_I_get_an_error_using_Perl">Why do I get an error using
Perl's here-doc syntax (&lt;&lt;), that says &quot;Can't find string terminator
anywhere before EOF&quot;?</a></h2>
<p>This is a weird error that occurs when your string terminator is on the last
line of your script. With a script like:</p>
<pre>
    print &lt;&lt;&quot;END&quot;;
    The snake is old, and his skin is cold.
    END
</pre>
<p>perl is looking for the word END on a line by itself, followed by a line-feed
character (\n). If the END is the last line of your script, you have to remember
to hit &lt;Enter&gt; after the word END, so that Perl can recognize it as the
string terminator.</p>
<p>Most UNIX text editors will do this automatically. Most Windows text editors
won't. Thus the problem.</p>
<p>Note that this can also cause a problem with Perl formats, since these are
terminated with a single . on a line by itself. However, it's much more rare,
since programmers often specify the format for output at the top rather than at
the bottom of a file.</p>
