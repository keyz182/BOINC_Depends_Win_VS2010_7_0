<h1>Benchmarking PerlEx Performance</h1>

<p>We have provided a few examples below to illustrate the performance improvements
your applications can gain by using PerlEx.  Performance will vary depending on the
environment in which they are run (hardware, memory, web server configuration, etc.).  
It is also important to note that these examples are with a single client accessing 
your web server.  For more extensive performance testing we have provided links to
some free performance testing software at the end of this section.</p>

<h2>PerlEx Benchmarking</h2>
<p><a href="benchmarks/frame_plex.plex?script=simple.plex" target="bmout">Simple Benchmark</a></p>
	<p>This example compares the execution times of loading 100 linked pages.  This
	test demonstrates running a simple CGI application under PerlEx without change.</p>

<p><b>The following examples utilize PerlEx to provide persistent data across connections
to further improve performance.</b></p>

<p><a href="benchmarks/frame_plex.plex?script=spell.plex" target="bmout">Persistence Benchmark</a></p>
	<p>This example compares the execution times of loading 25 pages that load
	a 400K file containing words for a spell check program.  Each load then spell
	checks 100 words.</p>

<p><a href="benchmarks/frame_plex.plex?script=zipcgi.plex" target="bmout">Persistent Database Benchmark</a></p>
	<p>This example compares the execution times of loading 25 pages.  Each page
	requires a connection to a database via the DBI module, however, no
	database access other than the connection is executed.  This shows the overhead
	of making the database connection in regular CGI, and how persisting those connections
	with PerlEx::DBI can improve overall performance of your website.  <b>To run this
	example, you will need to have DBI and DBD::ODBC installed.</b>  You can install these modules by
	running "ppm install DBI DBD::ODBC" at a command prompt.</p>

<p><a href="benchmarks/frame_plex.plex?script=qotd.plex" target="bmout">Web Service Client Benchmark</a></p>
	<p>The Web Service Client benchmark uses SOAP::Lite to access a SOAP server
	running under PerlEx.  The PerlEx Client is able to parse the WSDL file, and persist that data for consecutive
	uses.  The CGI Client must retrieve and parse the WSDL file on each request.</p>

<p><a href="benchmarks/frame_plex.plex?script=echo1.plex" target="bmout">SOAP::Lite</a></p>
	<p>This benchmark demonstrates performance differences between using SOAP::Lite with PerlEx to serve SOAP objects as
	compared to using SOAP::Lite as a CGI SOAP server.  Clients in both tests are SOAP::Lite clients running
	under PerlEx.</p>
 
<h2>Other Benchmarking tools</h2>
<p><a href="http://homer.rte.microsoft.com/" target="_new">WAS, Microsoft Web Application Stress Tool</a></p>
<p>Microsoft Web Application Stress is a simulation tool that is designed to 
realistically reproduce multiple browsers requesting pages from a web application.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mindcraft.com/webstone/" target="_new">WebStone 2.5</a></p>
<p>WebStone simulates multiple clients in order to stress web servers.</p>
