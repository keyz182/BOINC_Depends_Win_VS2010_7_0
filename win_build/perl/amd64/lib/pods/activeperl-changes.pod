=item *

The following security vulnerabilities in the Crypt::SSLeay module
were addressed in this release by upgrading the OpenSSL libraries to
version 0.9.8k:

=over

=item CVE-2009-0590 (ASN1 printing crash)

The function ASN1_STRING_print_ex() when used to print a BMPString or
UniversalString will crash with an invalid memory access if the
encoded length of the string is illegal.

Any OpenSSL application which prints out the contents of a certificate
could be affected by this bug, including SSL servers, clients and
S/MIME software.

=item CVE-2009-0789 (Invalid ASN1 clearing check)

When a malformed ASN1 structure is received it's contents are freed up
and zeroed and an error condition returned. On 64-bit Windows this can
cause an invalid memory access later resulting in a crash when some
invalid structures are read, for example RSA public keys.

Any OpenSSL application on 64-bit Windows which uses the public key of
an untrusted certificate could be crashed by a malformed
structure. Including SSL servers, clients, CA and S/MIME software.

=item CVE-2008-5077 (Incorrect checks for malformed signatures)

Several functions inside OpenSSL incorrectly checked the result after
calling the EVP_VerifyFinal function, allowing a malformed signature
to be treated as a good signature rather than as an error.  This issue
affected the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS.

One way to exploit this flaw would be for a remote attacker who is in
control of a malicious server or who can use a 'man in the middle'
attack to present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate
chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

=back

=item *

The C<-p> function used to always return a false value on Windows.  It
now correctly detects if the filehandle argument is a pipe or not.  Also
the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant is now defined.

=item *

A potential buffer overflow in Perl for ISAPI has been fixed.  Whenever
Perl for ISAPI wrote an error message to the log file it would
potentially write beyond the end of a heap buffer.

=item *

Fix for File::Path::rmtree symlink attack (CVE-2008-2827).

=item *

PPM v4.3 is now included.  This version of PPM should be considerable
faster at parsing the F<package.xml> file and in updating the local
database.  This version also supports installing packages from
F<.ppmx> files.

=item *

PPM on Windows and Linux will use the "new" ActiveState PPM
repositories currently at http://ppm.activestate.com/beta which have a
bigger selection of modules available and will allow updating of
bundled core modules when updates become available.

The new repositories are configured on the server side; other
platforms will be switched to the new repositories once they become
available for them automatically.

The new PPM repositories include both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries for
ActivePerl 5.10 (only for Windows and Linux right now).

=item *

Updated Net::Ping from 2.33 to 2.35 to make it less noisy.

=item *

Tweaks to make the CPAN shell less noisy.

=item *

The tkkit libraries used by the C<Tkx> module have been updated with
the latest changes from ActiveTcl 8.5.4.

=item *

The openssl library linked into the C<Crypt-SSLeay> module has been
updated to version 0.9.8h (was 0.9.8g).  This upgrade fixes two
security flaws; see L<http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20080528.txt>
(CVE-2008-0891 and CVE-2008-0891).

ActivePerl::Config on Windows now dynamically sets the
$Config{ccversion} to the version of C<cl.exe>.  This allows
ExtUtils::MakeMaker to generate and embed manifest files into
extension DLL when required by the specific version of the C compiler.

=item *

The GCC support for Windows in ActivePerl::Config now adds the
C<-mms-bitfields> option to the C<ccflags> when compiling with GCC.
This forces identical struct layouts with Visual C++, which is used to
compile ActivePerl itself.  This has become important because core
Perl 5.10 now uses bit-fields for some important structures.

=item *

On OS X the supplied F<sitecustomize.pl> script adds the
F<~/Library/ActivePerl/lib> directory to @INC, and PPM will install
into this directory by default because the
C</usr/local/ActivePerl-5.10/site/lib> directory isn't writable
without C<sudo>.  Unfortunately F<~/Library/ActivePerl/lib> was also
used by ActivePerl 5.8, so you could end up with a mixture of 5.8 and
5.10 modules in that directory.  This release uses
F<~/Library/ActivePerl-5.10/lib> as a per-user Perl 5.10 specific
module area.

=item *

Signal handling code would segfault with some Linux kernel and glibc
versions.  This problem has been fixed.

=item *

On Windows there is a special form of the system() function to start
processes asynchronously: C<< system(1, $cmd) >>.  It returns the
process id instead of the exit status so that the spawning application
can eventually use waitpid() to wait for the external process to
terminate.  Previous Perl releases only returned the lower 16 bits of
the process id; this version returns all 32 bits.

=item *

The following modules have been added to ActivePerl 5.10.0.1003:

    Algorithm-Diff-1.1902
    Bit-Vector-6.4
    Carp-Clan-6.00
    Class-Accessor-0.31
    Crypt-SSLeay-0.57
    DBD-CSV-0.22
    DBD-ODBC-1.15
    DBD-Oracle-1.21
    Date-Calc-5.4
    File-HomeDir-0.69
    File-Which-0.05
    GD-2.39
    GD-Graph-1.4308
    GD-Text-0.86
    JSON-2.09
    JSON-XS-2.2
    Net-Telnet-3.03
    PPM-Repositories-0.14
    SQL-Statement-1.15
    Sub-Uplevel-0.1901
    Test-Differences-0.47
    Test-Exception-0.27
    Text-CSV_XS-0.45
    Text-Diff-0.35
    Text-Glob-0.08
    WWW-Mechanize-1.34-r1
    Win32-API-0.55
    YAML-LibYAML-0.26

The DBD::Oracle module is only included in the 32-bit releases of
ActivePerl for Windows and Linux.  It does not include the Oracle
client libraries; instead it requires that either the regular client
libraries or the Oracle Instant Client is already installed and
configured on the system.

ActiveState recommends DBI and DBD::ODBC for accessing databases
using ODBC.  The Win32::ODBC module continues to be provided for
backwards compatibility, but new code should exclusively use
DBD::ODBC.

The PPM-Repositories module supplies a list of PPM repositories
provided by sources outside ActiveState.  It makes it easier to
discover and configure additional repositories in PPM.  For example
you can display a list of repositories available for the current
platform with:

    ppm repo suggest

Adding e.g. the University of Winnipeg repository maintained by Randy
Kobes is then as easy as:

    ppm repo add uwinnipeg

The PPM-Repositories list is used by the PPM GUI client as well.

The following modules have been updated to their latest version:

    DBI upgraded from 1.601 to 1.604

    HTML-Tagset upgraded from 3.10 to 3.20

    LWP upgraded from 5.808 to 5.812-r1

    URI upgraded from 1.35 to 1.36

=item *

The libwin32 module collection has been replaced by its individual
modules.  This will make it easier to update these modules via PPM
in the future:

    Win32-EventLog
    Win32-File
    Win32-FileSecurity
    Win32-IPC

=over 3

=item *

This build corresponds to the Perl 5.10.0 source code release.

=item *

The 1000 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
builds in the 600 or 800 series.  Any extensions built using binaries
from the ActivePerl 600 or 800 series will need to be recompiled.
Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been
built for 600 or 800 series builds.

=item *

Significant changes that have occurred in the 5.10.0 release
are documented in L<perl5100delta>.

=item *

The Time::Local module has been fixed to work properly with 64-bit
versions of ActivePerl for dates beyond 2038.

=item *

The limit on the number of sockets that can be specified in a single
select() call on Windows has been increased from about 64 to over 2000.
Please note though that using select() with a large number of sockets
on Windows is rather slow.

=back

=head2 Build 1000 Beta Thursday, Nov 22, 2007

This build is based on the first release candidate of the Perl 5.10
source code release.  Since Perl 5.10 is not yet complete, this build
is designated as a Beta and will be followed by a final build once
Perl 5.10 is officially released.

Please use this beta build to try out new features in Perl 5.10 and to
test source level compatibility of your existing Perl code under this
new release (note that Perl 5.10 is not binary compatible to earlier
releases).
