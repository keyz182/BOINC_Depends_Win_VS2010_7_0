<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>
<pre>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</pre>
<p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code>warnings</code> pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-w</strong>
and <strong>-W</strong> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code>
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlvar.html">the perlvar manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-X</strong> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#eval">eval in the perlfunc manpage</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.
See <a href="../../lib/warnings.html">the warnings manpage</a>.</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="accept" class="item"><code>accept()</code> on closed socket %s</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code>use subs</code> pragma).</p>

<dd>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code>CORE::</code> prefix
on the operator (e.g. <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#log"><code>CORE::log($x)</code></a>) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="../../lib/pods/perlsub.html#subroutine_attributes">Subroutine Attributes in the perlsub manpage</a> or

<p>(F) You wrote something like <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr/a-z-0//</code></a> which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a <code>-</code> character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr/a-z-0//</code></a> was synonymous with
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr/a-y//</code></a>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p>

<p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code>//</code>), substitution (<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#s_"><code>s///</code></a>), and
transliteration (<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr///</code></a>) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value -- the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash -- and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#grep">grep in the perlfunc manpage</a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#map">map in the perlfunc manpage</a> for

<dd>
<p>(F) The argument to <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#exists"><code>exists()</code></a> for <code>exists &amp;sub</code> must be a subroutine

<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers take care of transforming
data between external and internal representations.)  Perl stopped parsing
the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer.
If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be
the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>

<dt><strong>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</strong>

<p>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the main
thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it's a good idea to first collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then exit from the main
thread.  See <a href="../../lib/threads.html">the threads manpage</a>.</p>

<p>(P internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.</p>

</li>
<dt><strong><a name="attempt_to_free_nonexistent_shared_string2" class="item">Attempt to free nonexistent shared string</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(P internal) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other

<dt><strong><a name="attempt_to_free_temp_prematurely" class="item">Attempt to free temp prematurely</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
<code>free_tmps()</code> routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the <code>free_tmps()</code> routine gets a chance, which means that the
<code>free_tmps()</code> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.</p>

</li>
<dt><strong><a name="attempt_to_free_unreferenced_scalar" class="item">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that <code>SvREFCNT_dec()</code> was called too many times, or
that <code>SvREFCNT_inc()</code> was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.</p>

<p>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an

<p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack"><code>pack()</code></a> template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack"><code>pack()</code></a> template to

<dd>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <a href="#stat"><code>stat()</code></a> routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking
routine knows about the Perl <a href="#stat"><code>stat</code></a> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>

This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating

locale system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not
dead serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that
Perl can and will use, the script will be run.  Before you really fix
the problem, however, you will get the same error message each time

<dt><strong>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</strong>

<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code>AUTOLOAD</code> subroutines

$obj-</code><code>bar()</code> &gt;&gt;).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code>AUTOLOAD</code> for non-methods from a base class
named <code>BaseClass</code>, execute <code>*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</code> during
startup.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> </span><span class="operator">{</span> <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$a</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> f </span><span class="operator">{</span> <span class="variable">$a</span> <span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet. Conversely,
the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> </span><span class="operator">{</span> <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$a</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="keyword">eval</span> <span class="string">'sub f { $a }'</span> <span class="operator">}-&gt;();</span>
</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> f </span><span class="operator">{</span>

sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip

your script.</p>

<p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared,
which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.  (If it IS
what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</p>

<dd>
<p>(F) When trying to initialise the random seed for hashes, Perl could
not get any randomness out of your system.  This usually indicates
Something Very Wrong.</p>
