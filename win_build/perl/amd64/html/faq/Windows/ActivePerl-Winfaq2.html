<h2><a name="What_is_ISAPI_">What is ISAPI?</a></h2>
<p>ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) is an API for
writing extensions to web servers. It was originally developed by Process
Software, and adopted by Microsoft as its standard server API<font size="-1">.</font>
It complements or replaces the Common Gateway Interface <font size="-1">(</font>CGI<font size="-1">),</font>
the standard interprocess protocol for writing extensions to web servers.</p>
<p>ISAPI's main advantage over CGI is that it uses dynamic-link library <font size="-1">(DLL)</font>
function calls to communicate with extension components, rather than environment
variables and standard <font size="-1">I/O,</font> as CGI does. There's a lot of
overhead when starting new processes on Win32 platforms, and DLL calls eliminate
the need for new processes, thus reducing the running time.</p>
<p>Although it was originally developed for Microsoft Internet Information
Server, many Windows NT-hosted web servers now support ISAPI<font size="-1">.</font>
See <a class="doc" href="ActivePerl-Winfaq6.html#supported_web_servers">What web
servers support ActivePerl?</a> for the names of a few. If your server isn't
there, check its documentation.</p>
 
<h2><a name="What_is_Perl_for_ISAPI_">What is Perl for ISAPI?</a></h2>
<p>Perl for ISAPI<font size="-1">,</font> is an ISAPI extension that runs Perl
scripts on Win32 platforms.</p>
<p>Perl for ISAPI is mainly used for creating dynamic content on World Wide Web
sites. Writing Perl scripts that run under PerlIS is not much different than
writing scripts for the Common Gateway Interface <font size="-1">(</font>CGI<font size="-1">).</font></p>
<p>Perl for ISAPI doesn't have much general purpose use. For general purpose
programming, stick with the perl interpreter (<em>perl.exe</em>).</p>
<p>You may also see Perl for ISAPI referred to as PerlIS. PerlIS is the name of
the Perl for ISAPI DLL<font size="-1">.</font></p>
 
<h2><a name="Where_can_I_get_Perl_for_ISAPI_">Where can I get Perl for ISAPI?</a></h2>
<p>Perl for ISAPI is distributed as a part of the ActivePerl distribution. You
can optionally install it when installing ActivePerl.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Why_should_I_use_Perl_for_ISAPI_">Why should I use Perl for ISAPI
rather than Perl for Win32 (perl.exe)?</a></h2>
<p>The short answer is: it's faster. The long answer gets kind of technical, but
it goes like this:</p>
<p>The main advantage of PerlIS over <em>perl.exe</em> is that PerlIS runs as a
DLL in the web server's process space. Because Win32 platforms set up a
protected memory space for each process that is started, there's a lot of
overhead in starting a new process or program. Passing scripts to an
interpreter, such as <em>perl.exe</em>, requires starting a new process for
every script, which gets expensive in terms of system resources.</p>
<p>DLLs, on the other hand, don't need their own process space; they use the
space of the process that calls them. They don't require nearly as much overhead
to start, and once loaded they stay loaded until the calling process ends.
PerlIS therefore runs Perl scripts with a quicker turn-around time than <em>perl.exe</em>.</p>
<p>Extra care should be taken when you write PerlIS applications. It is
difficult to crash the web server using <font size="-1">CGI,</font> but because
the PerlIS <font size="-1">DLL</font> runs in the process space of the server,
your web server is more susceptible to crashes and hangs caused by programming
errors.</p>
