=head1 NAME

DBD::ODBC - ODBC Driver for DBI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DBI;

  $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:ODBC:DSN', 'user', 'password');

See L<DBI> for more information.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Change log and FAQs

Please note that the change log has been moved to
DBD::ODBC::Changes.pm. To access this documentation, use
C<perldoc DBD::ODBC::Changes>.

The FAQs have also moved to DBD::ODBC::FAQ.pm. To access the FAQs use
C<perldoc DBD::ODBC::FAQ>.

=head2 Important note about the tests

Please note that some tests may fail or report they are unsupported on
this platform.  Notably Oracle's ODBC driver will fail the "advanced"
binding tests in t/08bind2.t.  These tests run perfectly under SQL
Server 2000. This is normal and expected.  Until Oracle fixes their
drivers to do the right thing from an ODBC perspective, it's going to
be tough to fix the issue.  The workaround for Oracle is to bind date
types with SQL_TIMESTAMP.  Also note that some tests may be skipped,
such as t/09multi.t, if your driver doesn't seem to support returning
multiple result sets.  This is normal.

=head2 Version Control

DBD::ODBC source code is under version control at svn.perl.org.  If
you would like to use the "bleeding" edge version, you can get the
latest from svn.perl.org via Subversion version control.  Note there
is no guarantee that this version is any different than what you get
from the tarball from CPAN, but it might be :)

You may read about Subversion at L<http://subversion.tigris.org>

You can get a subversion client from there and check dbd-odbc out via:

   svn checkout http://svn.perl.org/modules/dbd-odbc/trunk <your directory name here>

Which will pull all the files from the subversion trunk to your
specified directory. If you want to see what has changed since the
last release of DBD::ODBC read the Changes file or use "svn log" to
get a list of checked in changes.

=head2 Contributing

Please use Subversion (see above) to get the latest version of
DBD::ODBC from the trunk and submit any patches against that.

Please, before submitting a patch:

   svn update
   <try and included a test which demonstrates the fix/change working>
   <test your patch>
   svn diff > describe_my_diffs.patch

and send the resulting file to me and cc the dbi-users@perl.org
mailing list (if you are not a member - why not!).

=head2 Private attributes common to connection and statement handles

=head3 odbc_ignore_named_placeholders

Use this if you have special needs (such as Oracle triggers, etc)
where :new or :name mean something special and are not just place
holder names You I<must> then use ? for binding parameters.  Example:

 $dbh->{odbc_ignore_named_placeholders} = 1;
 $dbh->do("create trigger foo as if :new.x <> :old.x then ... etc");

Without this, DBD::ODBC will think :new and :old are placeholders for
binding and get confused.

=head3 odbc_default_bind_type

This value defaults to 0.

Older versions of DBD::ODBC assumed that the binding type was 12
(SQL_VARCHAR).  Newer versions default to 0, which means that
DBD::ODBC will attempt to query the driver via SQLDescribeParam to
determine the correct type.  If the driver doesn't support
SQLDescribeParam, then DBD::ODBC falls back to using SQL_VARCHAR as
the default, unless overridden by bind_param().

=head3 odbc_force_rebind

This is to handle special cases, especially when using multiple result sets.
Set this before execute to "force" DBD::ODBC to re-obtain the result set's
number of columns and column types for each execute.  Especially useful for
calling stored procedures which may return different result sets each
execute.  The only performance penalty is during execute(), but I didn't
want to incur that penalty for all circumstances.  It is probably fairly
rare that this occurs.  This attribute will be automatically set when
multiple result sets are triggered.  Most people shouldn't have to worry
about this.

=head3 odbc_async_exec

Allow asynchronous execution of queries.  This causes a spin-loop
(with a small "sleep") until the SQL is complete.  This is useful,
however, if you want the error handling and asynchronous messages (see
the L</odbc_err_handler> and t/20SQLServer.t for an example of this.

=head3 odbc_query_timeout

This allows you to change the ODBC query timeout (the ODBC statement
attribute SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT). ODBC defines the query time out as
the number of seconds to wait for a SQL statement to execute before
returning to the application. A value of 0 (the default) means there
is no time out. B<Do not confuse this with the ODBC attributes
SQL_ATTR_LOGIN_TIMEOUT and SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT>. Add

  { odbc_query_timeout => 30 }

to your connect, set on the dbh before creating a statement or
explicitly set it on your statement handle. The odbc_query_timeout on
a statement is inherited from the parent connection.

Note that internally DBD::ODBC only sets the query timeout if you set it
explicitly and the default of 0 (no time out) is implemented by the
ODBC driver and not DBD::ODBC.

Note that some ODBC drivers implement a maximum query timeout value
and will limit time outs set above their maximum. You may see a
warning if your time out is capped by the driver but there is
currently no way to retrieve the capped value back from the driver.

Note that some drivers may not support this attribute.

See t/20SqlServer.t for an example.

=head2 Private connection attributes

=head3 odbc_err_handler

Allow errors to be handled by the application.  A call-back function
supplied by the application to handle or ignore messages.

The callback function receives three parameters: state (string),
error (string) and the native error code (number).

If the error handler returns 0, the error is ignored, otherwise the
error is passed through the normal DBI error handling.

This can also be used for procedures under MS SQL Server (Sybase too,
probably) to obtain messages from system procedures such as DBCC.
Check t/20SQLServer.t and t/10handler.t.

=head3 odbc_exec_direct

Force DBD::ODBC to use SQLExecDirect instead of SQLPrepare/SQLExecute.

There are drivers that only support SQLExecDirect and the DBD::ODBC
do() override does not allow returning result sets.  Therefore, the
way to do this now is to set the attribute odbc_exec_direct.

NOTE: You may also want to use this option if you are creating
temporary objects (e.g., tables) in MS SQL Server and for some
reason cannot use the C<do> method. see
L<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms131667.aspx> which says
I<Prepared statements cannot be used to create temporary objects on
SQL Server 2000 or later...>. Without odbc_exec_direct, the temporary
object will disappear before you can use it.

There are currently two ways to get this:

    $dbh->prepare($sql, { odbc_exec_direct => 1});

and

    $dbh->{odbc_exec_direct} = 1;

=head3 SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER

This, while available via get_info() is captured here.  I may get rid
of this as I only used it for debugging purposes.

=head3 odbc_cursortype

This allows multiple concurrent statements on SQL*Server.  In your
connect, add

  { odbc_cursortype => 2 }.

If you are using DBI > 1.41, you should also be able to use

 { odbc_cursortype => DBI::SQL_CURSOR_DYNAMIC }

instead.  For example:

    my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:ODBC:$DSN", $user, $pass,
                  { RaiseError => 1, odbc_cursortype => 2});
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare("one statement");
    my $sth2 = $dbh->prepare("two statement");
    $sth->execute;
    my @row;
    while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array) {
       $sth2->execute($row[0]);
    }

See t/20SqlServer.t for an example.

=head3 odbc_has_unicode

A read-only attribute signifying whether DBD::ODBC was built with the
C macro WITH_UNICODE or not. A value of 1 indicates DBD::ODBC was built
with WITH_UNICODE else the value returned is 0.

Building WITH_UNICODE affects columns and parameters which are
SQL_C_WCHAR, SQL_WCHAR, SQL_WVARCHAR, and SQL_WLONGVARCHAR.

When odbc_has_unicode is 1, DBD::ODBC will:

=over

=item bind columns the database declares as wide characters as SQL_Wxxx

This means that UNICODE data stored in these columns will be returned
to Perl in UTF-8 and with the UTF8 flag set.

=item bind parameters the database declares as wide characters as SQL_Wxxx

Parameters bound where the database declares the parameter as being
a wide character (or where the parameter type is explicitly set to a
wide type - SQL_Wxxx) can be UTF8 in Perl and will be mapped to UTF16
before passing to the driver.

=back

NOTE: You will need at least Perl 5.8.1 to use UNICODE with DBD::ODBC.

NOTE: At this time SQL statements are still treated as native encoding
i.e. DBD::ODBC does not call SQLPrepareW with UNICODE strings. If you
need a unicode constant in an SQL statement, you have to pass it as
parameter or use SQL functions to convert your constant from native
encoding to Unicode.

NOTE: Binding of unicode output parameters is coded but untested.

NOTE: When building DBD::ODBC on Windows ($^O eq 'MSWin32') the
WITH_UNICODE macro is automatically added. To disable specify -nou as
an argument to Makefile.PL (e.g. nmake Makefile.PL -nou). On non-Windows
platforms the WITH_UNICODE macro is B<not> enabled by default and to enable
you need to specify the -u argument to Makefile.PL. Please bare in mind
that some ODBC drivers do not support SQL_Wxxx columns or parameters.

NOTE: Unicode support on Windows 64 bit platforms is currently
untested.  Let me know how you get on with it.

UNICODE support in ODBC Drivers differs considerably. Please read the
README.unicode file for further details.

=head3 odbc_version

This was added prior to the move to ODBC 3.x to allow the caller to
"force" ODBC 3.0 compatibility.  It's probably not as useful now, but
it allowed get_info and get_type_info to return correct/updated
information that ODBC 2.x didn't permit/provide.  Since DBD::ODBC is
now 3.x, this can be used to force 2.x behavior via something like: my

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:ODBC:$DSN", $user, $pass,
                      { odbc_version =>2});

=head2 Private statement attributes

=head3 odbc_more_results

Use this attribute to determine if there are more result sets
available.  SQL Server supports this feature.  Use this as follows:

do {
   my @row;
   while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array()) {
      # do stuff here
   }
} while ($sth->{odbc_more_results});

Note that with multiple result sets and output parameters (i.e. using
bind_param_inout, don't expect output parameters to be bound until ALL
result sets have been retrieved.

=head2 Private DBD::ODBC Functions

You use DBD::ODBC private functions like this:

  $dbh->func(arg, private_function_name);

=head3 GetInfo

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's get_info method.>

This function maps to the ODBC SQLGetInfo call and the argument
should be a valid ODBC information type (see ODBC specification).
e.g.

  $value = $dbh->func(6, 'GetInfo');

which returns the SQL_DRIVER_NAME.

This function returns a scalar value, which can be a numeric or string
value depending on the information value requested.

=head3 SQLGetTypeInfo

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's type_info and
type_info_all methods.>

This function maps to the ODBC SQLGetTypeInfo API and the argument
should be a SQL type number (e.g. SQL_VARCHAR) or
SQL_ALL_TYPES. SQLGetTypeInfo returns information about a data type
supported by the data source.

e.g.

  use DBI qw(:sql_types);

  $sth = $dbh->func(SQL_ALL_TYPES, GetTypeInfo);
  DBI::dump_results($sth);

This function returns a DBI statement handle for the SQLGetTypeInfo
result-set containing many columns of type attributes (see ODBC
specification).

NOTE: It is VERY important that the use DBI includes the
qw(:sql_types) so that values like SQL_VARCHAR are correctly
interpreted.  This "imports" the sql type names into the program's
name space.  A very common mistake is to forget the qw(:sql_types) and
obtain strange results.

=head3 GetFunctions

This function maps to the ODBC SQLGetFunctions API which returns
information on whether a function is supported by the ODBC driver.

The argument should be SQL_API_ALL_FUNCTIONS (0) for all functions or
a valid ODBC function number (e.g. SQL_API_SQLDESCRIBEPARAM which is
58). See ODBC specification or examine your sqlext.h and sql.h header
files for all the SQL_API_XXX macros.

If called with SQL_API_ALL_FUNCTIONS (0), then a 100 element array is
returned where each element will contain a '1' if the ODBC function with
that SQL_API_XXX index is supported or '' if it is not.

If called with a specific SQL_API_XXX value for a single function it will
return true if the ODBC driver supports that function, otherwise false.

e.g.


    my @x = $dbh->func(0,"GetFunctions");
    print "SQLDescribeParam is supported\n" if ($x[58]);

or

    print "SQLDescribeParam is supported\n"
        if $dbh->func(58, "GetFunctions");

=head3 GetStatistics

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's statistics_info
method.>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLStatistics API.
You call SQLStatistics like this:

  $dbh->func($catalog, $schema, $table, $unique, 'GetStatistics');

Prior to DBD::ODBC 1.16 $unique was not defined as being true/false or
SQL_INDEX_UNIQUE/SQL_INDEX_ALL. In fact, whatever value you provided
for $unique was passed through to the ODBC API SQLStatistics call
unchanged. This changed in 1.16, where $unique became a true/false
value which is interpreted into SQL_INDEX_UNIQUE for true and
SQL_INDEX_ALL for false.

=head3 GetForeignKeys

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's foreign_key_info
method.>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLForeignKeys API.
You call SQLForeignKeys like this:

  $dbh->func($pcatalog, $pschema, $ptable,
             $fcatalog, $fschema, $ftable,
             "GetForeignKeys");

=head3 GetPrimaryKeys

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's primary_key_info
method.>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLPrimaryKeys API.
You call SQLPrimaryKeys like this:

  $dbh->func($catalog, $schema, $table, "GetPrimaryKeys");

=head3 data_sources

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's data_sources
method.>

You call data_sources like this:

  @dsns = $dbh->func("data_sources);

Handled since 0.21.

=head3 GetSpecialColumns

See the ODBC specification for the SQLSpecialColumns API.
You call SQLSpecialColumns like this:

  $dbh->func($identifier, $catalog, $schema, $table, $scope,
             $nullable, 'GetSpecialColumns');

Handled as of version 0.28

head3 ColAttributes

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's statement attributes
NAME, TYPE, PRECISION, SCLARE, NULLABLE etc).>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLColAttributes API.
You call SQLColAttributes like this:

  $dbh->func($column, $ftype, "ColAttributes");

head3 DescribeCol

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's statement attributes
NAME, TYPE, PRECISION, SCLARE, NULLABLE etc).>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLDescribeCol API.
You call SQLDescribeCol like this:

  @info = $dbh->func($column, "DescribeCol");

The returned array contains the column attributes in the order described
in the ODBC specification for SQLDescribeCol.

=head2 Tracing

DBD::ODBC now supports the parse_trace_flag and parse_trace_flags
methods introduced in DBI 1.42 (see DBI for a full description).  As
of DBI 1.604, the only trace flag defined which is relevant to
DBD::ODBC is 'SQL' which DBD::ODBC supports by outputting the SQL
strings (after modification) passed to the prepare and do methods.

Currently DBD::ODBC only supports one private trace flag.  The
'odbcdev' trace flag is used to output development tracing so it
should not be relevant in normal use.

To enable tracing of particular flags you use:

  $h->trace($h->parse_trace_flags('SQL|odbcdev'));
  $h->trace($h->parse_trace_flags('1|odbcdev'));

In the first case 'SQL' and 'odbcdev' tracing is enabled on $h. In the
second case trace level 1 is set and 'odbcdev' tracing is enabled.

If you want to enable a DBD::ODBC private trace flag before connecting
you need to do something like:

  use DBD::ODBC;
  DBI->trace(DBD::ODBC->parse_trace_flag('odbcdev');

DBD::ODBC outputs tracing at levels 3 and above (as levels 1 and 2 are
reserved for DBI).

=head2 Deviations from the DBI specification

=head3 Mixed placeholder types

There are 3 conventions for place holders in DBI. These are '?', ':N'
and ':name' (where 'N' is a number and 'name' is an alpha numeric
string not beginning with a number). DBD::ODBC supports all these methods
for naming placeholders but you must only use one method throughout
a particular SQL string. If you mix placeholder methods you will get
an error like:

  Can't mix placeholder styles (1/2)

=head3 Using the same placeholder more than once

DBD::ODBC does not support (currently) the use of one placeholder
more than once in the a single SQL string. i.e.,

  insert into foo values (:bar, :p1, :p2, :bar);

is not supported because 'bar' is used more than once but:

  insert into foo values(:bar, :p1, :p2)

is ok. If you do the former you will get an error like:

  DBD::ODBC does not yet support binding a named parameter more than once

=head3 Binding named placeholders

Although the DBI documentation (as of 1.604) does not say how named
parameters are bound Tim Bunce has said that in Oracle they are bound
with the leading ':' as part of the name and that has always been the
case. i.e.,

  prepare("insert into mytable values (:fred)");
  bind_param(":foo", 1);

DBD::ODBC does not support binding named parameters with the ':' introducer.
In the above example you must use:

  bind_param("foo", 1);

In discussion on the dbi-dev list is was suggested that the ':' could
be made optional and there were no basic objections but it has not
made it's way into the pod yet.

=head2 Connect without DSN

The ability to connect without a full DSN is introduced in version
0.21.

Example (using MS Access):
	my $DSN = 'driver=Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb);dbq=\\\\cheese\\g$\\perltest.mdb';
	my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:ODBC:$DSN", '','')
		or die "$DBI::errstr\n";

=head2 Using DBD::ODBC with web servers under Win32.

=over 4

=item General Commentary re web database access

This should be a DBI faq, actually, but this has somewhat of an
Win32/ODBC twist to it.

Typically, the Web server is installed as an NT service or a Windows
95/98 service.  This typically means that the web server itself does
not have the same environment and permissions the web developer does.
This situation, of course, can and does apply to Unix web servers.
Under Win32, however, the problems are usually slightly different.

=item Defining your DSN -- which type should I use?

Under Win32 take care to define your DSN as a system DSN, not as a user
DSN.  The system DSN is a "global" one, while the user is local to a
user.  Typically, as stated above, the web server is "logged in" as a
different user than the web developer.  This helps cause the situation
where someone asks why a script succeeds from the command line, but
fails when called from the web server.

=item Defining your DSN -- careful selection of the file itself is important!

For file based drivers, rather than client server drivers, the file
path is VERY important.  There are a few things to keep in mind.  This
applies to, for example, MS Access databases.

1) If the file is on an NTFS partition, check to make sure that the Web
B<service> user has permissions to access that file.

2) If the file is on a remote computer, check to make sure the Web
B<service> user has permissions to access the file.

3) If the file is on a remote computer, try using a UNC path the file,
rather than a X:\ notation.  This can be VERY important as services
don't quite get the same access permissions to the mapped drive letters
B<and>, more importantly, the drive letters themselves are GLOBAL to
the machine.  That means that if the service tries to access Z:, the Z:
it gets can depend upon the user who is logged into the machine at the
time.  (I've tested this while I was developing a service -- it's ugly
and worth avoiding at all costs).

Unfortunately, the Access ODBC driver that I have does not allow one to
specify the UNC path, only the X:\ notation.  There is at least one way
around that.  The simplest is probably to use Regedit and go to
(assuming it's a system DSN, of course)
HKEY_LOCAL_USERS\SOFTWARE\ODBC\"YOUR DSN" You will see a few settings
which are typically driver specific.  The important value to change for
the Access driver, for example, is the DBQ value.  That's actually the
file name of the Access database.

=head2 Connect without DSN

The ability to connect without a full DSN is introduced in version 0.21.

Example (using MS Access):
	my $DSN = 'driver=Microsoft Access Driver
(*.mdb);dbq=\\\\cheese\\g$\\perltest.mdb';
	my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:ODBC:$DSN", '','')
		or die "$DBI::errstr\n";

The above sample uses Microsoft's UNC naming convention to point to the MSAccess
file (\\\\cheese\\g$\\perltest.mdb).  The dbq parameter tells the access driver
which file to use for the database.

Example (using MSSQL Server):
      my $DSN = 'driver={SQL Server};Server=server_name;
      database=database_name;uid=user;pwd=password;';
      my $dbh  = DBI->connect("dbi:ODBC:$DSN") or die "$DBI::errstr\n";
